"Klaus Schwab says that through, ""Prescriptive Programming"", elections won't be necessary in the future... To understand what he meant, two upcoming productions - a movie titled ""Civil War"" and a documentary ""God And Country"" give us a clue. These pieces, launching before the pivotal 2024 elections, seem to be more than mere entertainment. They appear to be chess pieces in a grander game of social and political influence, a game that some theorize is akin to what might be called ""prescriptive programming."" Let's start with the film ""Civil War."" Picture this: a trailer showcasing a society torn apart by right-wing extremism, journalists cast as the valiant truth-seekers and defenders of democracy. The narrative is potent, timely, and, for some, deeply concerning. It's a storyline that seems to fit snugly into the prevailing winds of political discourse, reinforcing certain narratives while subtly undermining others. Then there's ""God And Country,"" a documentary poised to take a critical look at Christian Nationalism. In a nation where faith and politics often intertwine in complex and sometimes controversial ways, this film promises to add fuel to an already blazing fire of debate and discussion. These productions aren't merely isolated cultural artifacts; they are potential catalysts in an era where media content is increasingly viewed through the lens of political impact and psychological influence. This perspective recalls a speculative concept mentioned by Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. In a discussion about the future impact of AI, Schwab mused on technology's evolution from analytical to predictive, and possibly to prescriptive capabilities. Schwab's musings and these upcoming media releases form a curious mosaic. These films, with their charged themes and timely releases, seem to embody the essence of the concept of ""Prescriptive Programming"" - media content that might be seen as prescribing a certain viewpoint or attitude towards contemporary political and social issues. The idea that media can influence public opinion isn't novel. What's intriguing here is the alignment of these filmic narratives with broader societal and political currents, particularly as America approaches a critical election. It's not about overt propaganda; it's more subtle, a shaping of the cultural milieu, a gentle nudging of public consciousness in a direction that aligns with certain ideologies or perspectives. In dissecting these developments, one must tread the line between skepticism and open-mindedness. It's easy to veer into the realm of conspiracy theories, but it's equally naive to dismiss the profound impact media can have on public perception and opinion. These films, irrespective of their artistic merit or intent, are poised to become part of the larger conversation about media's role in shaping not just culture, but also the political landscape. As the world gears up for the releases of ""Civil War"" and ""God And Country,"" it's worth pondering the power of media in our lives. Are these productions mere reflections of our times, or are they tools subtly sculpting the contours of our societal and political understanding?"

"🚨🚨HUGE BREAKING: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has just DENIED former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' request to move his trial from Georgia State Court to Federal Court. Meadows was hoping, among other things, to get a jury more favorable to him. His only hope now is to take his appeal to the Supreme Court. How does this news make you feel?"
"A whole lot of people were saying we were going to be in a recession by now, and they got it very wrong. President Biden's policies not only kept us from a recession, they've allowed the economy to THRIVE. A whole lot of people owe our President an apology."
"CLEAN AIR IS NOT ""WOKE"": Imagine being the governor of a state, and thinking that stoking an irrational fear of ""wokeness"" is more important than responsible action on clean air for your residents. Ron DeSantis has, once again, failed Florida residents in an ill-advised bid to make a misguided political statement. Incredibly, Florida is the sole state that rejected millions aimed at reducing emissions. In 2021, Congress allocated $6.4 billion to combat tailpipe emissions and address climate change impacts across states. Among the recipients, Florida was earmarked to receive $320 million, ranking as the third-highest allocation nationwide. Initiatives proposed by the state's Department of Transportation included expanding trucker parking at rest stops to alleviate the statewide shortage that prolonged drivers' journeys and increased pollution. Additionally, suggestions encompassed investing in electric buses and roundabouts to curtail emissions during traffic light idling. Despite these eco-friendly proposals, last month saw Florida's Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Jared Perdue, declining participation in the federal program, labeling the initiative as part of the ""continued politicization of our roadways."" His sentiments mirrored those of Governor Ron DeSantis, who has controversially dismissed climate change as the ""politicization of the weather."" Strikingly, Florida now stands isolated as the sole state rejecting the funding, and any mention of the state's emission-reducing plan has been expunged from its official website. Even in contrast to Texas, known for its conservative stance, Florida remains isolated in its refusal of the allocated funds. Texas, while often vying for conservative credentials alongside Governor DeSantis, has confirmed its intent to accept the allocated $641 million. It's no wonder DeSantis' presidential campaign is on life support."
"If you only watch ONE video today, watch student Zander Moricz BRILLIANTLY call out the anti-LGBTQ hypocrisy of Moms for Liberty threesome member Bridget Ziegler. 🚨This is incredible."
"If a member of the Democratic party made Hitler-like statements that immigrants were ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" Republicans would be calling for that person to resign, but you wouldn't be able to hear them because Democrats would be screaming it out at the top of our lungs, demanding a resignation. THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS USING HITLER'S TALKING POINTS. That Republicans haven't come out in unity to condemn trump's remarks is a glaring indictment against the lack of courage and principles in that party. Country before party, FFS."
"🚨CLARENCE THOMAS: PAY TO STAY In shocking new revelations from ProPublica, it has been learned that conservative money started flowing in SCOTUS Justice Clarence Thomas' direction when he complained that he might leave the Supreme Court. The remarkable reporting reveals that Thomas, who was earning $173,000 in 2000 (the equivalent of $300K in 2023), was not satisfied with the amount of money he was making as a SCOTUS Justice and openly griped that Congress should increase their pay. On the plane ride home from a speech, Thomas told Florida GOP Rep. Cliff Stearns that if members of Congress didn't boost their salaries and lift a ban on paid speeches, “one or more justices will leave soon,” meaning as soon as the next 12 months. From that moment on, Thomas was the recipient of a steady flow of very expensive gifts from wealthy conservatives like Harlan Crow, including everything from free vacations on super yachts and private jets to tuition payments for the private school his grandnephew attended. Rep. Stearns said about Thomas' remarks, in a recent interview, “His importance as a conservative was paramount. We wanted to make sure he felt comfortable in his job and he was being paid properly.” This should be a MUCH bigger story."

Next spaces explaining how you cure fear of abandonment ?
Ppl with abandonment issues are life’s biggest losers and it’s ain’t close. They categorically can’t let themselves win out of fear it’ll be taken away. They have to preemptively sabotage themselves before anyone can do it them. It’s a dragon in them they can’t suppress
"Absolute comedy how the most unimportant people in the world pretend to be busy, take 3 hours to respond etc But the wealthiest, most successful & important ppl I’ve ever met are always available, answering the phone at 2am if needed; respond in seconds Lesson in there"
If ur shy in America you are colossally fucked on almost every level. Will get devoured by everyone louder than you. Gotta constantly shove chips across the felt and put yourself out there to capture even a drop of rainwater. Gains in America are surreal and disproportionate
Not in America. America is the land of flash & noise. All the success here comes from making waves and being loud way before success. Draws in the most cosmic scale opportunities. The grind in a fox hole types in America get a social handicap levied on them
A man’s success is proportional to how much debt he can tolerate. One of few things in life that plagues beyond the psyche and looms in the gut & spirit. Fighting through a curtain of debt makes you overshoot every target by a couple miles
Blindness is a superpower when it comes to solving your worst problems. If you could see the gravity and weight for what it really is you’d be frantic & spin out. The blindness doesn’t let you accept defeat. You heal faster. The blindness lets you see
"I keep having a recurring nightmare I am in a Brute space I raise my hand to ask a question He calls on me “Simon, shoot” I fumble My mic won’t work I am in a panic “Simon, ye there?” Sweat rolls down my face “Cmon man I wanna keep this rolling” I’m really panicking now Blood pressure through the roof I can’t believe I’m messing this up I realise my mic was unplugged Easy fix Finally It’s working “uhh hi…Brute? I was…uhh…thinking. You said I should uhh…smoke cigarettes but uh.. I’ve been smoking a pack a day… uh… the last… uh… sorry… uh I forgot what I was saying uhh…” “What the fuck?” I am then kicked from the space, blocked by Brute, and become a laughing stock on money twitter I wake up screaming, inconsolable It always feels so real I have been afraid that this might be a premonition so I haven’t be able to attend a single live Brute space in weeks This has taken a huge toll on me and my family Does anyone have any cigarette brand recommendations?"
Also instructive to note strictly removing bad habits never takes anyone to the next level. Life is very much a yin yang pulley system. The best of the best use bad habits as wood for the fire. The true archimedes lever
Midwits fool themselves into thinking “highest self” means abstinence from all bad habits. V gay attitude to life. Dousing water on fire. Smart ppl have a complex vein of bad habits enmeshed with the good. Asymmetry creates unique winning lanes
Can march your way all the way to the top just asking for shit everyone else is afraid to ask for. The heaviest gates can open with an ask. It’s not qualification dependent either. It’s sheer audacity. Same way a minor paper cut can slice open your finger

"Facts. I said weeks ago if you fall through the trap door of depression a whole new world opens up to you. A little more pain here, a little more sprinkled there & now you’re back on your feet laughing. It’s stagnation at depression that kills you. Keep falling"

I would have taken a bullet for that man, but now he’s contradicted himself, and that hurts."

The jury was in deliberations for a day, and found that the vicious lies spread about the 2 civil servants were damaging enough to warrant such a high amount. Until as recently as 2 days ago, Giuliani expressed no remorse; in fact, he doubled down. “Of course I don’t regret it. I told the truth,” Giuliani told reporters. “They were engaged in changing votes. … Stay tuned.” Rudy is in the finding out stage."

I love that is going viral for sensibly stating that America is not putting its citizens first while opining about how it’s our moral duty to help every nation overseas. I only wish she had done this before she helped to elect a senile man whose party has single-handedly created the migrant crisis that taxpayers are now suffering the consequences from. You get what you vote for. Whether she is sincere and is now ready to learn rather than be used by far-left politicians will become clear in the next election cycle. Maybe she and I should sit down. For old time’s sake. 🤔

"My entire career I have been publicly put down and called stupid names. I have been caricatured as anti-vax, an Uncle Tom, a disgrace to my own black community, a Putin-Puppet, a transphobe, a homophobe, an inspiration to a New Zealand terrorist, a Zionist shill, an antisemite, a sell-out, an internalized misogynist. If you name it, I can probably produce the article in which I’ve been called it. My entire career I’ve been told my 15 minutes would be up soon. Needless to say, it’s been a long 15 minutes. Because people can see past these attempts to shut down conversation. I’ve kept the hunger but more importantly I have earned people’s trust. I refuse to go “establishment” despite the very real truth that pressure surmounts the higher you climb. I haven’t turned my back on friends along way, although I’ve gotten much clarity on the ones who were pretending to be my friends in order to manipulate my voice. I still do not claim to know everything, but I do know that the world needs more speech, not less. It really is that simple."
"I’m not sure why I’m trending again (frankly, I’m sick of it after this week) but as I am about to embark on maternity leave, there are perhaps a few things I would like to say: After a little over a year of producing my podcast, I would like to clarify who I am, and who I am not— the former of which I thought would have been obvious by now. I started my career being maimed and attacked as being “anti-black” and “self-hating” for challenging the Black Lives Matter narrative and the lockstep commitment that corporations, politicians, Hollywood and media had in fostering a hysterical illusion that the no one had the right to challenge the movement because “slavery”. I didn’t do this by telling the other side to shut up. In fact, I hosted the other side (BLM chapter leaders, and protesters) on my various platforms. I flew out to Atlanta and stood on stage with T.I and was disrespected for my unique stance at a hip-hop conference. I was similarly disrespected on the world stage by Dave Chapelle during a stand up he delivered following the death of George Floyd. I took all of this on the chin and was willing to become a punching bag and a laughing stock to many because reputation means little to me in the pursuit of truth. I’m not here to make friends or be well-liked. Life is not a popularity contest. I’m here to differentiate between truth and fiction so that my kids can grow up in a more honest world. Black Lives Matter, both as an organization and an ideology has been fundamentally exposed and is now recognized as fraudulent. This process took years plus more than a few good men that were willing to stand up to its lies—but it no longer holds any political significance. Frankly, because it never should have. Because BLM destroyed lives—chief among them BLACK lives and black neighborhoods. It is stunning to me that people who applauded me as I stood up and had conversations and rightfully critiqued (and continue to critique) the flaws in my own community, do not think that I should or would muster up the same courage to ask simple questions or make basic observations about theirs. There is no two-tier system in my mind. Your specific race, color, or creed does not make you above reproach. If you watch my podcast regularly you know how very true this is. I love and hate all of you with equal measure. Some people are wondering why I had the nerve to sit down with Norman Finkelstein today on my podcast— Norman is an accomplished academic, whose parents both survived the Holocaust who has made a name for himself defending Palestine. Lately, everything I tweet, say or don’t say has been under a microscope so rather then let people who think they are wizards and can magically “read between lines” invent something out of their own paranoid neuroses, let me clearly spell out the reason why for everyone here now: Because last week I had a pro-Israel Jewish man, Ami Kozak on my podcast. And he was amazing and he was respectful and we had a great dialogue that everyone in the comment section applauded and loved. Because it is important that in the pursuit of truth we hear ALL sides so that we can learn and independently conduct our own research. It really is that simple. So go listen to my podcast with Ami and go listen to my podcast with Norman and make an effort to make up your own mind. Here is what I have learned in politics. Never, ever trust anyone who only presents to you one side. Never trust anyone who yells at you for wanting to hear both sides. Never trust people who call you stupid and put you down for admitting that you don’t know everything. These people are authoritarians, not experts or respectable journalists. As just one example: the experts didn’t want to debate about Covid and vaccination for a reason. That’s because they were liars and frauds. I want everyone to know that a willingness to listen, research and learn is enough. It will always bring you closer to truth (Continued) …"

"Jeff Roe and Fatt Wolking () have QUIT the DeSantis super pac with just 4 weeks until Iowa. The DeSantis campaign is the worst campaign in the HISTORY of politics and the biggest grifters in politics (Axiom Strategies) will never get another serious client again. Good riddance, morons! MAGA!!!!"

"Many people are saying that trump is a Russian asset because a binder full of highly-classified information just went ""missing."" What do you think he did with it? Did he sell it? Buried with Ivana in Bedminster?"
"REMINDER: As the jury deliberates how much to award election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, recall that only a few days ago Rudy Giuliani refused to admit guilt. Instead, he compounded the damage to his own case. “Of course I don’t regret it. I told the truth,” Giuliani told a group of reporters. “They were engaged in changing votes. … Stay tuned.” Attorneys for Freeman and moss have asked the jury to award them $24 million each. We can only hope they heard Giuliani's recent remarks."
"If today were election day, I would be enthusiastically casting my vote for President Biden and VP Harris, as well as a straight DEM ticket to keep the Senate and flip the House. How about YOU? 🙏💙💪"
"🚨NEWS: Donald Trump has chilling plans for how he plans to use the United States military force, and it tracks right along with his stated intention to be a dictator ""on day one."" He plans to mobilize ""hundreds of thousands"" of troops to the U.S. southern border, and have them set up detention camps for detaining migrants, according to a new report from Rolling Stone. The report reveals that Stephen Miller, the architect of his ""child separation"" policy, has likely devised this border-closing scheme that would include between 100,000 to 300,000 troops, one unnamed source has estimated. The plan would even require pulling troops from bases abroad, such as in Germany. Trump's authoritarian tendencies would go completely unchecked in this scenario, as outlined in ""Project 2025,"" a blueprint for a 2nd Trump presidency that reveals his plan to only appoint people 100 percent loyal to him and him alone. The only hope for preventing his use of the military in such a manner would be the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of our military by Presidents as a domestic police unit. This is an unprecedented moment in American history, where we have to consider scenarios to protect ourselves from a former President's dictatorial impulses."
"As Republicans attack First Lady Jill Biden over random nonsense this holiday season, just going to drop this here for those who need the reminder: Melania Trump: ""Who gives a fuck about Christmas stuff and decorations, but I have to do it right?"
"Here's Donald Trump, saying the quiet part out loud as he promises tax cuts for the ""people that have a lot of money. You’re rich as hell."" Make sure everyone sees this."
"Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone who would like to see civil servants Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss awarded the MAXIMUM in their defamation case against Rudy Giuliani. What he did was reprehensible, he deserves to be penniless in prison for the rest of his days."
"Clarence Thomas cannot be trusted to do the right thing and recuse himself from Trump’s January 6th coup attempt case. If there has ever been a more compromised, less trustworthy SCOTUS justice than Thomas, I sure can’t think of one. He's worse than Justice Beer."
"If I needed a pilot for my plane, and my choices were: An older guy who had decades of experience but had a stutter, and had a kid who had a drug problem OR A guy who was 3 years younger, but previously flew the plane and allowed many passengers to die from a virus because he wanted to “play it down,” which caused many of the workers to lose their jobs, and when they fired him, he tried to crash the plane because he was afraid he'd go to prison for all of his crimes if he didn't have that job… Yeah, I'm picking the older guy with a stutter."
"So I guess if you have $2 Billion dollars or more here in America, you're free from getting hassled or grilled about it, even if you got it from the Saudis, huh? But let a brother steal a backpack, or try to sell loose cigarettes and he loses his life."
"🚨NEW ELEVEN FILMS🚨 In just under 3 years, Joe Biden has delivered unlike any President in modern history. 🇺🇸 If you're voting for Biden in 2024 repost: "
"Lmao, if you've been blocked by Rudy Giuliani, you're doing something right. 🏆💪"
"REMINDER: As women like Karen Cox are forced to travel out of Texas and other cruel states for abortions, Donald Trump believes they should be punished. 🚨Punish him and the GOP at the ballot box. PASS IT ON."
"LMAO, Rudy Giuliani's lawyer asked for the jury to ""have sympathy"" on his lying ass because he's 80. F*ck that. No sympathy. Take every damn penny."

"Insecurity is an absolute monster. Sets in when you defy your nature. You can overlay it with muscle, roids, money & you’ll be on top of the mountain with loud applause & all the accolades in the world. But the little voice in your head will tell you you ain’t shit."
The reason things never seem to work out when you absolutely need them to is cause you want it so bad you horseshoe into resisting it Cause you take matters into your own hands and it suppresses destiny Best things in life are always least expected.
"When someone says “you get a sick a pleasure out of it.” They’re right, if they’re talking to a winner."
Winners are always having fun. Exclusively. As a rule. What they find fun the average person does not. They can be entangled in the most disparaging horror show circus of a situation & find enjoyment in it. They see everything as a game. And all games winnable
"Introspection is a bigtime luck killer. You don’t want to know yourself too well as a man. So many times you need extra horsepower , your mind will block you with the governor chip bc you’re too aware. Slumps get worse the more you analyze the slump. Externalize everything."
Best times of your life are for remembering. Meant to be zipped through in the moment
Pleasure is the one mechanism you don’t fuck with. If you figure a way to life hack it thru fame or extreme wealth & sustain pleasure too long ur gonna blow a fuse & break something in you that doesn’t coen back. Too many examples to cite
Nothing will make a man sicker to his stomach than riding a prolonged wave of euphoria. The golden times are supposed to be a flash in the pan. People chase success for the good feelings they think that comes but being high for too long brings the darkest depression imaginable
Most pretend to be inspired witnessing figures do great things but really use it as an excuse to quit. They imagine the gap is so large it helps them justify tapping out
The why not me attitude is light years ahead more powerful than any other including the zero fucks given attitude If you’re not permanently living in why not me you’re always gonna stay low so you don’t get hit. Then you’re gonna hit the hardest
Embarrassment is worse than death?
"Man is the only thing in the universe that can tap out of living but still be alive. All the plants & animals in the jungle have no choice but to grow, thrive, and expand. Is why moving forward always is mandatory for man & letting the past crumble. You must outrun yourself"
"Men get 100% of their confidence from their psychological pursuits only. Plain and simple. The adventures, experiences, mental barriers they’ve endured. Getting a dream body, cash in the bank, bling etc just makes you shinier. Does fuck all for confidence"
Nah. Ego is your greatest ally. If you think you were born with defective firmware & you need to kill off aspects of your god given nature just phone it in. Just get a morphine drip and head to hospice care
The most astronomical wins of your life come from salvaging losses & taking wrong turns. The linear win stacking path is very very gay. Curating ur whole life to avoid mistakes turns you into a dull nerd. Flipping L’s into W’s brings unimaginable windfalls of money and success

Great interview I think this is what the majority of Americans feel
Candace Owens is handling all the media lies thrown at her with grace.
"This was a wonderful Ep. It gave a ton of perspective into the media talk surrounding and Shapiro. We would all do better to not make generalizations, or come to unfounded conclusions, without knowing all the facts."
"Just when I thought I couldn't possibly love more, she appeared on Tucker's show and elevated my support and admiration to levels I never knew were possible. 👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️👏🏻❤️"
Shut out the noise for a few minutes and watch this. I’m very glad I did — especially given all the talk around right now. It will be well worth your time.
"Based Owens, as usual. Expected nothing less. Handled this with grace and humility."
Ep. 39 Candace Owens responds to Ben Shapiro. TIMESTAMPS: (00:00) Candace is attacked – even when she’s right (4:27) Ben Shapiro’s comments (12:50) The emotional response to news out of Israel (23:05) Nikki Haley vs. free speech (30:34) 2024 predictions
"Bomb ass interview!!! Down to earth, common sense, educated, articulate and she stands by her beliefs. Even as they evolved. I love "
"“I’m also inspired by Elon Musk… his fight for freedom, what he did for Twitter is something… there are no words to illustrate what that meant in terms of the global conversation and he is a hero.” -Candace Owens ()"
CANDACE: Think of a person in West Virginia who had both his legs blown off and telling him if you dont agree with every war everywhere you're not pro-American
I don’t aim to have everyone agree with me always. I aim for people to see me as consistent in my viewpoints. I think that’s more important and in the end will win people over.
I never see the views of being accurately reflected in the media. I am glad I was able to bring that perspective.
This made me respect her even more. She is challenging the narrative and seeks for truth while being attacked. People have laid down for way to long and just accept the narrative. Those days are over.
hey guys below said if this video got 2.5k likes I get my own tds skin that might be free for everyone

Free speech is winning 🇺🇸
Alex Jones won the Censorship Cup!!!
DeSantis “influencer” Jebba Ellis is now defending Satan
New Hampshire is MAGA COUNTRY!
Trump isn’t scheduled to speak for another 2.5 hours and he already has a bigger crowd than every Desantis event this week combined
"Wow. Trump supporter went undercover as pro Desantis to find out that Desantis supporters are manipulating X algorithms to maximize visibility Not surprised at all. My entire “for you” page is filled with pro Desantis posts from random <2,000 follower accounts"
God bless . He will forever be known as America’s Mayor and a true American icon. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"The same “intel officials” who spied on Trump’s campaign, spread the Russian collusion lie, and called Hunter Biden’s laptop “Russian disinformation,” are spreading a new hoax about a binder. And the media is helping them spread it once again. Fortunately the American people are awake and aren’t going to fall for it this time. Trump 2024!"
You were already censured for your role in spreading the Russian collusion lie. Now you are spreading this. You are a sick man who should be expelled from congress.
"House Democrats illegitimately subpoenaed and harassed Trump kids , , and for YEARS. They complied with every subpoena and sat for over 100 hours of closed door testimony combined. Could you imagine the outrage from Democrat politicians if they refused to comply with a subpoena like Hunter?? House Republicans must hold crackhead Hunter in contempt!"
Now that’s our First Lady. God bless 
"Happy to birthday to the one and only, ! MAGA!"
"The evidence against the Biden Crime Family is crystal clear. Follow the bank records, witness testimony, and emails. A formal impeachment inquiry is long overdue, and we all know that if defied a subpoena, I would be applying for conjugal visits by now."

"🔥🔥🔥 just filed an ethics complaint against another judge overseeing Trump’s J6 case. Thank you, Elise!"
"Endorsements from the most unpopular governor in America, Karen Reynolds, and the fake evangelical “leader,” , have really hurt Rob DeSanctus in Iowa. Wow. Iowans, take nothing for granted however! Trump supporters must flood the polls on January 15th!!!"
Jared Kushner sat for 30+ hours of closed door testimony. Hunter Biden won’t even appear for his scheduled deposition. What is Hunter hiding? Who is he trying to protect? House Republicans have initiated contempt of Congress proceedings. Hunter is not above the law.

If you are falling apart it’s a sign you have strayed from your nature Nature doesn’t break. A mfer on his mission can withstand anything. Anything. Can squander a billion opportunities & still win bloodstained. That just nukes his shell. Spirit is protected from the mission
Late teens and 20’s is more fitted for crystallizing an imperturbable foundation than it is about success. Success comes later. Paves the way to take bigger risks in your 30’s & 40’s. Been Olympic lifting for 15 years w very few days off. I can take 2 years off and not touch a weight & I’ll still look and be athletic asf. You will see the silhouette of an athlete. Been too long engrained to go away. Same with social scene. Spent so much time in 20’s socializing I can go run missions for a year or two without socializing at all and pop back in the scene like nothing ever happened. Huge myth that you can’t be bolder when you get older. You have 100x the dynamite to send through the teeth of the gears
If u ever take a swing at an opportunity and feel like you have to nail it 1st try u don’t really want it. U’ve convinced yourself u do. When u really want something ur whole engine will calibrate for it. U have an infinity clip. U are careless bc you know it’s already yours
This is also where the “time heals” adage comes from. Time heals cuz there’s a lot of computational power & problem solving going on in your subconscious. One day you stop trying to force an answer and it’s just there
You have no business trying to understand why you’re good at what u do. Many things in the unconscious once bubble up to the surface dissolve. Once you try to grasp the technology behind y ur funny or speak well ur actively unweaving the power behind it. Auto pilot is supreme
The docuseries IS coming
Crazy how dudes are pretending to be GI Joe with this Israel stuff but haven’t spoken to a chick in years
Hardest thing for a man to do bar none is not to behave desperate when he actually is. Still saying no and rejecting dogshit opportunities even when you need things to pop makes living gods out of men. Chilling back steady riding the waves wounded & soon the best presents itself
Your problems should be so unique to your skill sets and talents that it would be way over a therapists head to even try to tackle it You can’t think your way out of anything. Mind is too dumb no matter how smart you are. You can YOLO your way out of anything though
Ur gonna regret all those times you didn’t waltz inside the smoky bar Go running amidst the thunder & lightning Get in your car at and blitz to the ocean for a midnight swim All the venues you walked by without peeking inside All the Hello’s you never said
Breathing that rarefied air
The way you think has 100x the anabolic effects than any supp or food you’ll ever take When you don’t want to change ur mentality you’ll turn to compounds in exchange & I promise you there’s nothing on earth you’ll ingest that’ll change you being a pussy in your head
"Doing things no man ever will gives you a swagger that literally can never be beaten out of you & you only need to touch it for a second. Portfolio could touch 10M for a day and tank 90% the next, that bravado ain’t going away even if you’re in a guillotine in the town square"
Entire new age concept of chasing “your highest self” is 100% bs Whole thing is enshrined In the notion that you can’t win if you make bad decisions. Winning big is always a combo of excellent & terrible decision making mixed together You can’t superb decision your way into the top. You can only superb decision your way into the middle
When u know ur destined for greatness there is no breaking point Uncan fuck things up a million X in a row &there’s never an iota of doubt it’s gonna work out When everything’s stacked Against you you’ll pray to god to add more & blow ur tires out. Just to stick ur chest out
Swerve around the bullshit
Remember seeing a poker player get mopped for 3 million in a cash game & upon his exit he was interviewed Girl asks him how he’s so calm. He said if flipping out would get me the money back I’d be flipping out right now All wisdom emanates from that comment
If you ever decide to take a non pre-prescribed path in life every action u take for urself will feel shameful af at first. Every act of freedom will feel awful. The dumbest thing you can do is let this make you stop. Ur consciousness is split & the shame means it’s melding back together. Ur psyche has to fuse again between the shadow and the spirit. Very few let these forces gel together cause it can take years of confusion terror and pain. But once they’re cross-stitched back together and you no longer are at the behest of others you’re a force of nature who can’t ever go back
Went to get my hair cut and it was so tangled the girl handed my a fine tooth comb and said get to work sister
The bond sisters have is irreplaceable.. for instance one time I noticed an inch long chin hair on my face and my sister said “oh that’s been there for years”
No no no no no no

My therapist is having a cyber monday sale. Is everything just like this now
I like snoopy but i don’t show it too much cuz i know he’s got a lot of parasocial relationships to deal with already
"Sadly, we see the same thing every Thanksgiving season. Piles and piles of food that an unhoused person is unlikely to be able to cook left outside on the ground near tents but not handed to anyone directly - so only the rats will eat it."
"I mean any amount of mutual aid is nice but it’s so much more than plating a thanksgiving meal. There are people who, year round, volunteer their time to help neighbors survive the increasing criminalization of poverty"
When you work in service spaces it’s well known that the holidays are jam-packed with certain people and groups helping out momentarily while the rest of the year they actively work against helping people get fed or housed
I will probably die owing the power company $1300 and I’ve just sort of learned to make peace with that
Built…. Good god Ellory
We can’t built more public transit because then who would post the yearly thanksgiving traffic tweet
"We can’t get universal health care, can’t cancel student loans, can’t provide clean water, housing or better public transportation, but The Pentagon can misplace $3.8 trillion. Not for the first time either. Stimulus checks caused inflation but not this? Funny how that works."
Please read this thread about and the way that for-profit health care fails to do the one thing it’s supposed to: provide access to care.

“is discord down for anyone else”
This transition is EVERYTHING
"Baby Brutus on the way. Had phone in pocket near my nuts my whole life, never blue blocked a thing and smoke 2+ packs a day for a decade. Optimizers down stupdenously"
Having a dream car; dream house in mind sets the bar too low & there’s no direct path to it Everything you want in life is lateral. Why you need mammoth sized goals. You’ll get all the dream shit along the way & wont even notice it
There’s a rung lower on the ladder than depression & it’s actually laughter. Funniest moments of your life can only come when you’ve given your all to smth & been temporarily crushed. Sink one rung below depression & you reach absolute hilarity
Hallmark trait of ADHD is letting problems stack up on you for inordinate stretches where everyone is panicking but you. Just to feel the breath of death on your neck. One day you wake up and decide to slash every single one of them & you never know when that’s gonna be
Never consciously learned a “skill” in my life. Anything extremely difficult I’ve ever done was just biting off way more than I could chew and figuring it on the go. Common denominator was always fun. Fun is the only true compass for acquiring anything worthwhile
"Some variation of zen/Buddhism is the apex philosophy. But you’ll never get there studying zen or Buddhism. Not even practicing it religiously will get you there. You travel the exact opposite direction & get your hands dirty, several portals thru hell & you Ricochet at zen"
Your entire life lies way beyond the little voice in your head that tells you you’ve had enough. 99% never even try to go past the voice that tells them to submit but that’s where every ounce of juice in life is Once you overpower that voice you experience Promethean will
"Surrendering will is such a gay attitude to life. Soon as you decide to quit smth the subconscious is gonna refuse to let you take control. Just like when a woman consciously decides she’s not gonna sleep with you she becomes more likely to do so. An alcoholics only chance is building a system that outruns the cravings. Maniacal fitness, eating foods of the gods, health freak to counterbalance the damage. Cannot afford to withdraw from society and estrange himself from the ordinary world of family And business. Needs a job that requires whip smarts/eye on ball/quick computive thinking. Can’t daydrink cuz system will fray. Needs to sew himself into position as proctor of a giant consequential meaningful life as chancellor. Will be forced to move quickly to stave and quell boredom. Drinking then becomes the reward not the escape. Juggling massive life autofills the need to taper the bottle. Men do not negotiate well with the subconscious. You’re bartering while half devoured in the jaws of a tiger. No leverage there. Already got the surplus bonfire of energy with the addiction. The idea is always to reinforce the scaffolding around that so you yourself are more powerful than the craving"
Gratitude is the cringe buzzword of the decade
Hilarious how neo-masculinity psyopped men into always fighting against themselves If you always have to discipline & control yourself to get things done you’re playing the wrong game If you have to slave drive yourself w whips & chains you lose to the guy who plays freely
"Anyone doing better than you has it way way worse than you. That’s why they’re better. It’s the penultimate paradox. You’d never wanna be in the shoes of those you look up to. The despair they’ve been through, the pain; the mauling They sacrifice themselves for wisdom"
Applies to business social life and competitive sports very well too. Too much second hand frame makes you stiff mentally and physically
Holding 2 much frame makes u too passive & steely. Miss out on a bunch of life. Should have 0 problem playing the head games women offer you. Show her you’re way better at it than she is. You got more energy than her. You’ll win every time. This is what I mean by monstrosity
Bro there’s an unspoken rule that you never ever lower your standards when you’re down on your luck. You fight tooth and nail to stay at the standard of living your accustomed to & you get unflappable confidence. Blow the $40 & treat urself like a king
If u don’t start living the life u want right now as in this very second ur in big trouble my friend. When the money and success does come u will feel awkward in your skin. 90% of desired success of any endeavor comes in the 1st month if ur earnest Only rule is u can’t fake it
Flip a coin. There will be a moment while it’s suspended in air you wish it lands on a specific side. That’s been your answer all along

You’re being shown what happens when you put in too much effort as a man. Watch the movie The Prestige One guy is jus casually winning. He puts in effort ofc but it’s lighthearted. The other guy is obliterating himself trying to chase the winner Winners r ALWAYS jus chilling
"Ur average guy needs a monumental disaster to get pissed & change . Death of family, burnt down house , nasty breakup But all the greats get pissed into action over the tiniest shit. Could be a hole in his shoe or his car door is jammed & it sets him off to go make 7 figs"

High vitality means short pain cycles. You have a few mini depressions a day but you break out quickly. A few blisses you also break out of. You can swirl in whirlpools of pain briefly but tip the nose up on the plane. An extended stay in any emotion means poor health
The notion men shud always be taming their emotions is a broken model. It’s stockpiling defense. I have 0 control over my emotions and see all of them as benevolent. I trust the system that produces them. If I’m enraged then I need to be. Men don’t hoard they unleash

Ego is the only mental & bodily defense against heartbreak. Nothing on earth can deal with pain like the ego can. It produces the raw desire to get back in the game. It razes through languish like a knife through butter. It brings you to ubermensch. It takes you to godhood
"It’s the opposite. The cherished horse of stoicism is an end of life philosophy. When you’re on the rise you gotta be relentless, dramatic, and slightly crazed with women. She can’t for one second believe she has more energy or intensity than you"
"If someone in ur household is sleeping and you try to be overly cautious, tip toe around sneak by they always wake up. When you move normally & open drawers etc in careless motion they never wake up Many things in life are like this"
There’s a cozy effervescent narrative that if you’re a phenom at your craft it’ll inspire the people around you. But it does the exact opposite. It makes Everyone quit. They open lanes for you and let you pass on by lest they feel they’ll never catch up.
"BREAKING: Anthony Alexander Antonio, the January 6th Capitol rioter who blamed ""Foxmania"" for his actions, pleaded guilty to felony charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding. The 29-year-old from Delaware, now facing a potential prison term of 33 to 51 months, was captured on security footage wielding a stolen riot shield in the midst of the Capitol chaos. Prosecutors revealed Antonio's alarming behavior, detailing how he failed to assist an officer being dragged down stairs, showcasing his active participation in the violence. Prior to the riot, Antonio, adorned in a bulletproof vest and a far-right ""Three Percenter"" patch, was caught on camera shouting, ""You want war? We got war. 1776 all over again."" Antonio gave an interview to the far-right news outlet VDARE at the Capitol, accusing the police of aggression. He justified his actions by expressing discontent with what he perceived as a stolen election, fueled by debunked conspiracies about voter fraud in Georgia. Antonio remarked, ""We lost lives in there. Two confirmed lives have been lost. Patriots, we took the Capitol and we’re not stopping. I will be back tonight. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe, but we’re not backing down."" He will, in fact, be backing down into a prison cell."
"11 years ago, a gunman killed 20 1st graders and 6 educators at Sandy Hook. In their memory, we passed reforms — but still must overcome gun industry dark money blocking an Assault Weapons Ban. No one’s political survival is worth more than our children’s survival: !"

"TWEEPS: 11 years ago today, the unthinkable happened at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT: 26 students and staff, including 20 children, were murdered by an AR-15 wielding gunman. The nation mourned. Our President wept. Republicans refused to do anything about it, except suggest fewer doors, arming teachers, and having our little ones practice shooting drills instead of their multiplication tables. And with that inaction, our kids are STILL being gunned down in schools. Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending on Twitter? Please and thank you. 🙏💪"

"🚨🚨NEWS: Bombshell revelations emerge as a report exposes Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the lead in the Biden impeachment inquiry, engaging in dubious business tactics similar to those he accuses President Biden of. James Comer has his own shell company! Co-owning six acres with a major campaign contributor, Comer transferred ownership to Farm Team Properties, a shadowy entity exploding in value, mirroring the opacity of Biden-associated companies, according to AP's Bryan Slodysko. ""The AP found that Farm Team Properties functions in a similarly opaque way as the companies used by the Bidens, masking his stake in the land that he co-owns with the donor from being revealed on his financial disclosure forms,"" reports Slodysko. Records label Farm Team Properties as Comer's wife's ""land management and real estate speculation"" company, leaving critical details undisclosed. The land, purchased eight years ago with donor Darren Cleary, raised eyebrows as Cleary sold Comer a 50% stake for $128,000. The timing, just days before Comer's congressional campaign announcement, adds fuel to the controversy. Cleary's businesses have donated approximately $70,000 to Comer's political campaigns, underscoring the intertwined nature of their financial dealings. This shocking revelation challenges Comer's credibility and raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. The striking resemblance to allegations against President Biden injects a new layer of complexity into the political landscape. As the spotlight intensifies, Comer should face scrutiny over financial dealings that echo the very accusations he hurls at the President."
"What gets me the most about Rudy Giuliani is that he brashly spread bold-faced lies about Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who were doing their civic duties, and he severely disrupted their lives. Just 2 days ago, he told a reporter he did not regret his actions towards those ladies because he told the truth. And he's STILL lying!!! Now that it's time for him to put up or shut up in court, that scumbag straight up chickened out. He deserves the most severe judicial penalties, give Ruby and Shaye their MILLIONS. 💰"

I LOVE that raised the bar to give us this amazing musical Christmas extravaganza. I'll take this over Melania's creepy blood Xmas ANY day.
"Good morning and Happy Thursday to everyone who agrees it's pathetic that MAGA Republicans ran on helping Americans, but WASTED their time on gas stoves, drag shows, ousting their Speaker, and now an impeachment inquiry. The self-destruction of the GOP is almost complete."
"Who else remembers in 2020 when trump claimed if Joe Biden is elected, ""the stock market will crash.""🤚 Wrong again, Spanky. It just hit 37,000 for the 1st time in U.S. history. 💪🇺🇸"
"For absolutely no reason at all, here's a list of people who asked trump for a preemptive pardon: Mark Meadows Rudy Giuliani Rep. Andy Biggs Rep. Mo Brooks Rep. Matt Gaetz Rep. Louie Gohmert Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Rep. Scott Perry John Eastman For the record, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed ""The president's not gonna pardon his son."" Built different."
"With the economy growing, inflation shrinking, and border crossings decreasing, MAGA Republicans were desperate to find something to distract Americans with. They settled for an evidence-free sham impeachment inquiry. The Republican problem is that they have no solutions."
"Yo, is anybody else watching Season 5 of Fargo? Because this show is maximum insane, funny, and I love it! Stellar cast with Juno Temple (from Ted Lasso), Jon Hamm, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Probably one of the wildest seasons to date so far. Highly recommend!!"
House Republicans are pushing a sham impeachment to distract from their failure to meet the kitchen table needs of the people and from their harrowing assaults on women’s reproductive freedoms. Democrats will not lose focus — we will keep working to deliver jobs and justice. -NP
"🚨🚨BREAKING: The House Republicans, unable to pass a budget, unable to pass any meaningful legislation since they have been in power, have just voted 221-212 to move forward with an impeachment inquiry on President Biden. It has already been determined by numerous Republican members of the House, and even members of the right wing media, that there is no evidence of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" to support an impeachment of the President. Utterly disgraceful."
BREAKING: House Republicans have just disgraced themselves further by voting for an impeachment inquiry of President Biden. I'm ready to make them pay at the ballot in 2024. Sick and tired of their bullshit.
"Rep. Raskin is right to call this latest stunt ""stupid, blundering"" because we've already SEEN it before: it's Benghazi 2.0. Lacking anything of real substance, they've chosen to chase conspiracy and false narratives with NO EVIDENCE of any wrongdoing."
"If you agree with Rep. Jamie Raskin's outrage over the preposterous waste of time and resources Republicans are focused on, then I suggest you follow us at where we're fed up with the political stunts the GOP is staging instead of actual policy and work."

Episode 1 ALEX JONES ON 𝕏: Premier of Documentary 'ENDGAME: Blueprint for Global Enslavement' -- PLUS Deep State Pushing Martial Law -- MUST WATCH!
"Threw together a quick compilation of my favorite Alex Jones clips, set to an appropriate soundtrack. This Little Light Of Mine: Alex Jones Edition"
"⚠️ There's more to Starlink's $900M subsidy denial than meets the eye... Recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) turned down Starlink’s bid for a nearly $866 million rural broadband subsidy, a part of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) program. The FCC's rationale? Starlink ""failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service"" to underserved rural areas. While at first glance, this may seem a straightforward regulatory decision, a deeper dive suggests there could be more at play here. The Timeline: A Curious Coincidence? Just 14 months ago, Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter, a move that sent ripples through the digital and political landscapes. His vision for X as a bastion of free speech and his recent actions, including the re-admittance of controversial figures like InfoWars' Alex Jones, have been both lauded and criticized. But could these moves have inadvertently placed Starlink in the crosshairs of an increasingly politicized regulatory environment? Yes. The FCC's decision, on the surface, hinges on procedural grounds. Starlink passed the preliminary application phase but supposedly stumbled in the more demanding long-form stage. Brendan Carr, an FCC commissioner, raised a valid question: Why was Starlink held to a precedent-setting standard, requiring it to demonstrate its service capabilities years ahead of schedule, a requirement not imposed on other awardees? It's hard not to wonder if there's a connection between Musk's endeavor to champion free speech on X and the denial of Starlink's subsidy. In a climate where tech moguls and their platforms are under constant scrutiny for their roles in shaping public discourse, could this be a subtle signal to those who dare to challenge the status quo? Musk's recent decisions on X have certainly not gone unnoticed. The implications of this subsidy denial decision extend beyond Starlink or even Musk himself. They reflect a broader trend where technological advancements and media platforms are increasingly caught in the crossfire of political agendas. In this high-stakes game, regulatory decisions, such as the one faced by Starlink, may carry undertones of larger battles being fought in the arena of public discourse and freedom of expression. This incident should serve as a wake-up call. We have reached a point where our government is blackmailing major corporations to fall in line with its political agenda."

"Rep. Jared Moskowitz BRILLIANTLY mocks Republicans for voting for an impeachment inquiry that is SO urgent, so serious, they're taking three weeks off. This is hilarious!"
"House Republicans are pushing impeachment as payback for Trump being impeached when he withheld aid to Ukraine. The longer Republicans take to provide aid to Ukraine, more people will die, more women will be raped, more children will be kidnapped — we MUST get the aid through."

"It's Dad. I'm calling to tell you I love you. I love you more than the whole world, pal. You gotta get some help. I don't know what to do. I know you don't either."" -- Joe Biden, in a voicemail to his son, Hunter, who was in the throes of addiction. The ONLY thing President Biden is guilty of is loving his son, which is not a crime. You could never accuse trump of that."
"Rep. Byron Donalds just feigned outrage that ""the son of the President"" is a tax cheat, when their leading presidential candidate is a HUGE tax cheat. Are they trying to impeach Hunter Biden?"
"Excellent point by Rep. Nadler: Even if there was evidence that Vice President Biden had committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" they would not count as impeachable offenses to President Biden. Those GOP clowns are chasing ghosts."
"Holy sh*t, Rep. Jamie Raskin blasting Republicans' ""stupid, blundering investigation"" keeping them from getting any work done. MUST SEE 🔥🔥🔥"
"On the day House Republicans are set to vote on an impeachment inquiry on President Biden, Senator Chuck Grassley admits he has ""no evidence"" and the facts don't point to President Biden's guilt on anything. Make sure everyone sees this. "
"Remember, the goal of the anti-abortion movement is to ban and criminalize abortion nationwide. It’s not about life. It’s not about health. It’s about power and control."
"Why are Republicans so afraid to question Hunter Biden under oath PUBLICLY? Is it because all of their so-called ""evidence"" reveals that their investigation is a nothingburger? Is it because they've been bragging that they have a big ole 12-inch whopper of a case, but publicly they'll be exposed of having a teeny-weeny micro peen of a case? Is it because, behind closed doors, they can cherry pick facts to frame a false narrative, but in public everyone will see and hear the facts about Hunter Biden's ACTUAL testimony without a filter? Is it all three? Something else?"
Make it make sense.
"If they're going to hold Hunter Biden in Contempt of Congress, they better make sure they get Gym Jordan, Scott Perry, and Andy Biggs for it too."
I thought Hunter's speech was eloquent and personal. He didn't deny that he made mistakes; he owned up to them. But he pushed back forcefully against the idea that his Dad had any involvement in his bad decisions. You'd think Republicans could respect personal responsibility.
"If you were glad to see Hunter Biden step up and fight back against scurrilous, relentless attacks from the GOP, I suggest you follow us at so you can join us in denouncing the fact-free, no evidence crusade against President Biden and his last surviving son."
"This hypocritical chucklef*ck Jim Jordan has the audacity to complain about Hunter Biden, who offered to testify PUBLICLY, when Jim Jordan himself avoided subpoenas. Not a single reporter has asked him to square that hypocrisy."
"🚨BREAKING: Rep. Jamie Raskin, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, ridicules House Republicans for pursuing an impeachment inquiry of President Biden with zero evidence: ""They have not laid a glove on President Biden. There is no evidence of committing any offense, much less an impeachable offense. This is an impeachment inquiry where no one has been able to define what criminal or Constitutional offense they're looking for… Mysteries are called a whodunnit because it starts with a crime and then you try to determine who committed it. This is more like a 'what is it,' not a whodunnit, we don't know what the crime is. There are thousands and thousands of pages of evidence, but all of the evidence demonstrates, beyond any reasonable doubt, that President Joe Biden is not guilty of any impeachable offense."" Jamie Raskin is a national treasure."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: Hunter Biden BLASTS Republicans attacking him in a public press conference: ""For six years, I've been the target of the unrelenting trump attack machine asking ""Where's Hunter?"" Well here's my answer: I'm right here."" BRAVO!!👏👏👏"

In July, a partial judgment was entered against Cardillo. In a motion filed today, 12/13/20, Bogachek seeks final summary judgment in the matter and a denial of Cardillo’s third request for reconsideration. Cardillo filed for reconsideration of the merits of the case twice before, and his motions were denied both times."

What a nice message! I bet Rob Desantis appreciated this kind message from George Santos. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
This is the way.
"Democrats held Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena. Both were convicted and are facing prison time. When House Republicans find Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress, Merrick Garland must apply the law equally. Will justice for Hunter Biden's defiance be swift, or will the DOJ show the American people, yet again, that there is a two-tiered justice system?"
"Wow the memers are really making a difference this election cycle. The media is now paying attention because the memers totally destroyed Rob DeSanctimonious. Great work and the , you guys are patriots!"
Democrats did this to Bannon for failing to comply with an illegitimate subpoena from an illegitimate committee. What will House Republicans do to Hunter Biden for refusing to comply with a legitimate subpoena from a legitimate committee?
"Democrats held Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena from the politically motivated, sham January 6th Committee. He is now facing prison time for that decision. Hunter Biden is defying a legitimate Congressional subpoena. Republicans must hold Hunter in contempt!"
Hunter Biden just refused to show up for his congressional testimony. I’m looking forward to the same amount of outrage from the media as they’d have if I blew off any of my 5 congressional subpoenas… but since they’re covering for Joe Biden & his corruption I won’t hold my breath.
Hunter Biden’s press conference stunt in front of the capitol was the closest he got to fulfilling his deposition/ testimony before Congress. I support holding Hunter in contempt for his refusal to supply his deposition and ask our conference to support this action.

"Logan Paul isn’t a real man; he said if I show up, he will fight me in MMA. Now he’s being a coward and pulling out. I’m surprised Nina never lets any of her men pull out."
Back to doing what I love: real fighting. Great work today! ❤️ 🥋
This was the original walkout song that Dazn pulled because Logan said he wouldn’t fight if I used it 😂😂😂
"Apparently for walkout he requested a track that had Nina’s voice over it, that’s why DAZN & Misfits didn’t allow it 😭"
Wtf is this 😂
Dillon Danis really sold out the highest selling PPV of 2023 (more than Canelo vs Spence & all UFC events this year)
"PFL has bought Bellator. The only way I'll stay is if they book me against Jake Paul; otherwise, I'm going to the UFC."
Nina offered a settlement of 400k today she can go suck another dick.
That fat security guard saved your life Coward.
Logan Paul shaking on a bet that if Dillon Danis shows up to the boxing match he would rematch him in MMA Can Logan Paul keep his word?
I’m ready to fight let’s do this.
"What a show, brother! Well done! The world is excited for what’s next! "

What this guy doesn’t understand is retention is doing absolutely 0 for him. What’s working is his maniacal monolithic obsession over something absurd. Fanatical placebo makes ppl move differently. And it works on chicks cuz he’s driven himself psycho. Lesson in there
The ones harnessing negativity for fuel are the most upbeat optimistic mfers you’ll ever meet in your life. They’re already dead. It’s the ones who LARP as high vibe positivity you gotta worry about. They’re one bad life event away from absolutely unraveling
There’s quite literally 2 reasons and 2 reasons only any man strikes success and it’s having an astronomical sex drive or an astronomical depression
"Theres literally no amount of no fap, hitting the gym, cutting social media that will make a man take an action Low drive has Nothing to do with chemicals in the brain. It’s way deeper than that There needs to be a lesion in a man’s soul & heart to harness negativity as fuel"

The line you walk as a man is having enough swagger loaded in the chamber that you don’t give a fuck if you lose anything but also being protective of what you have at the same time. Loose but tight grip. Hold on too tight and you break everything
"Brute made a great point about how the body automatically and subconsciously converges towards homeostasis, so you need to reverse engineer success by intentionally creating an imbalance that will lead to massive overcompensation that catapults you into a radical change."
There’s a horseshoe phenomenon when you hit rock bottom & let go of the thing you cared so much about that you actually end up in abundance mindset
Leaning into your nature
Having a great personal struggle is massive competitive advantage in this day and age Very tough getting out of the middle w/o a genuine negative to fuel you. Adderral & performance drugs compensate for this but people with the negative are blessed cuz they don’t need it
Middle gets wrecked yet again

Still haven’t been drug tested.
"During all the media events and weigh-ins, Logan tried to roast me with a prop puppet, but it always backfired. He hasn't learned that playing with fire gets you burned! 🎤"
Bark back if you want.
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture.
"Show your face pussy, I broke it yesterday never fuck with a gangster."
This kid calls himself a fighter but needs another man to protect him 😂
Logan Paul and Dillon Danis finally faced off after weigh-ins
"Since Logan Paul missed weight and the fight has been cancelled, I'll be facing Jake Paul tomorrow night, live on DAZN!"
This fake commission is paid for by KSI and Misfits. They do whatever they say to get paid. This whole thing is a bunch of bullshit.
"This isn’t complaining. What is fair is fair. No drug tests, breaking the weigh-in rules – I ain’t nobody’s bitch. I run the show. Fuck Logan Paul."
"He claims he made weight, but it doesn't count. The rules are the rules. If he wants to be viewed as a genuine boxer, he needs to follow the 11 o'clock deadline. Look at the time he posted. It's not fair; I had to follow the rules, and he isn't an exception."
"The commission's rules state that weigh-ins are between 10 and 11. If you miss the 11 o'clock deadline, you've missed weight. I weighed in at 10:15, but Logan still hasn't. The commission said that if he doesn't arrive by the 11am deadline, the fight is off. He missed the weight, but then called misfits and changed the rules to give himself an extra hour. We should be on an even playing field, he shouldn't get special treatment. He’s already got more juice than Tropicana. He missed the weight, plain and simple. They’re trying to handicap me as much as possible."
Fights off you missed weight.
Logan Paul just missed weight.
"Good morning and Happy Wednesday to everyone who agrees that America deserves better than a lying, vengeful, narcissistic, insane, sexual assaulting, twice-impeached, 91-felony-indicted sociopath as the leader of our country. That's why I'm voting Biden/Harris! 🇺🇸💪"
"The Texas Supreme Court's cruel ruling against Kate Cox proves once again that the GOP isn't interested in life, they just want to control women. We need them OUT of our bedrooms, out of our medical decisions, and out of Congress. VOTE THEM OUT IN 2024."
"Fuck you, Susan Collins, and your votes to approve Roe-breaking SCOTUS Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett. You gave the arsonist matches, and you're complaining that the burning house is too hot."
"There are countless Trump supporters who would be alive and free instead of dead or in prison because of the many lies told and repeated by Fox News. And they continue to spread the lies, because that's what sells. Fox News' greed and lies are a deadly combination."
"I wonder where Elise Stefanik's outrage was when trump was having dinner with raging White supremacist antisemite Nick Fuentes? Or when he said ""very good people on both sides"" when Charlottesville Nazis chanted ""Jews will not replace us?"" Or when Ron DeSantis was casually allowing Nazis to brandish their swastikas everywhere? Where was her outrage then?"
"NEWS: The election workers who were publicly defamed and harassed by Rudy Giuliani have their share of horror stories, but being asked by a potential employer at a fast food chain if she was a ""traitor"" was more than unnerving for Shaye Moss. Moss and Ruby Freeman are suing Giuliani for up to $43 million dollars for defamatory accusations he'd made when he alleged that they were passing around fake votes on a USB like drug dealers. Moss had applied for a job at Chick-fil-A, and had a relatively successful interview experience until the interviewer showed her an online article with the word ""TRAITOR"" across the page and asked “Is this you? Is this true?"" Giuliani recently doubled down on his accusations, asked by a reporter if he regretted his statements he denied that, insisting he spoke the truth. One can only hope that Giuliani is held accountable for the disruption he caused to those women's lives."
"If you only watch ONE video today, let it be Rep. Jim McGovern, calling out House Republicans' foolish, evidence-free impeachment stunt as being about ""vengeance, retaliation, and distraction."" This is EXCELLENT. "
"Ann Coulter is a truly horrible person who, once a year, tweets something that makes sense, or that many people agree with. She's 100% right about the cruelty of the Kate Cox situation, but she has supported the anti-choice movement and people who made this happen, so she gets no credit for this. None."
It’s hard to imagine learning a pregnancy you wanted is no longer viable. Harder to imagine being told you had to risk your life anyway and were being forced to continue the pregnancy. Harder still to be forced to travel to another state to access critical health care because a group of men have the power to control you. This is real life in Texas and much of the US in 2023.
"Raise your hand if you haven't tried to extort the President of Ukraine in exchange for dirt on your political opponent. 🤚 Thank you, President Biden."
"🚨BREAKING: House Republicans voted today to ensure that their investigations will be as shady as possible, omitting the words ""open and transparent"" from an amendment on the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This is despite MAGA House Speaker Mike Johnson pledging ""to undertake this process methodically and transparently."" GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota is clearly opposed to moving forward on impeachment without receipts. “We have had enough political impeachments in this country,"" Johnson said. ""I don't like the stonewalling the administration has done, but, listen, if we don't have the receipts, then that should constrain what the House does.” Ranking member Jim McGovern (D-MA) was outraged by the process in which Republicans seem determined to operate in the shadows. ""All we're asking for is the gentleman to put back in the words 'open and transparent.'"" McGovern said. ""For some reason Republicans deliberately removed it. None of us can figure out why."
"FRIENDS: Can we get 1,000 quick replies and retweets to get trending so everyone knows that funding Ukraine's fight against Putin's invasion is in America's national security interests?"

"TWEEPS: Ukraine is in a fight for their lives. Our support has allowed them to fight Putin's invasion without any American troops on the ground. Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"I remember when people were saying that trump was playing 3D chess, but he wasn't even playing tiddly winks. Jack Smith is playing 3D chess, and he's busting trump's ASS."
"MAGA Speaker Mike Johnson, who blurs out the faces of January 6th attackers so they can't be identified by police, and supports a presidential candidate with 91 felony indictments, calls House Republicans ""the rule of law team."" Absolutely ridiculous."
"Good morning and Happy Tuesday to everyone who stands with Ukraine, and agrees that it is critical for America to support the goal of defeating Putin by pushing that dictator all the way out of Ukraine. SLAVA UKRAINI!!! 🇺🇦💪🇺🇸"
There is no way the forefathers intended for a President to be immune from prosecution if he incited insurrection against America. There's no language in the oath that says defend the Constitution UNLESS you lose an election. Lock trump's sore-losing ass up.
"Charlie Kirk complained that Taylor Swift was going to destroy the country because she used her platform to get “4 million girls registered in 24 hours.” I'd say that's pretty badass, and I'd love to see a whole lot more of that action in 2024.

"The sham January 6th Committee rejected my offer to publicly testify. Would’ve been great TV! Anyway, I was forced to testify over zoom (while wearing a hat that said ‘Subpoenaed’ on it). You don’t always get what you want, Hunter!"
First Casey DeSantis called for out of state participation in the Iowa caucus. Now RINO Chris Sununu is calling on democrats to illegally vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary. Desperate times call for desperate (& illegal) measures I suppose.
"Arguably the most viral moment from DeSantis’ town hall last night was when Jake Tapper called him “Rob.” Congratulations memers, you successfully renamed DeSantis!"
Omg Jake Tapper just called Desantis “Rob” 😭
"Just a couple of months ago Team DeSantis was trashing Trump for doing a CNN town hall. Today, they are cheering on DeSantis’ CNN town hall. These people have zero principles or core beliefs. They are liars and frauds. Trump 2024."
There is something seriously “off” about this guy. Yikes
Holy sh*t Jake Tapper just called Ron DeSantis “Rob” during his low energy town hall. 😂😂😂😭😭😭
"BREAKING: America First superstar endorses President ! Thank you, Senator Hawley! MAGA!"

Poor Rob… No one wants to be his friend
"💔""This is for all the lonely people""🎶 ""Thinking that life has passed them by"" "
The Iowa caucuses are 5 weeks away. President Trump holds his LARGEST lead ever in the Hawkeye State. Poll after poll shows that Trump will be the GOP nominee and DEFEAT Joe Biden in 2024. 
Interesting take account created in September 2023
So true! Chris Sununu is a blow hard moron who has no clue what time it is in our country. His endorsement will move exactly zero votes. New Hampshire is Trump country!
Why hasn’t Iowa Governor/DeSantis’ running mate Karen Reynolds called for the immediate removal of the satanic altar in the Iowa state capital? It should be removed NOW! Sick!
"Today is the last day DeSantis can remove himself from the Florida Presidential primary ballot. He is currently losing his home state by 40%. He will be a lame duck, WEAK Governor when he returns to Tallahassee once his failing campaign comes to an end. I have never seen someone destroy their political career the way Rob has."
Ron Desantis now has to drive around in a bus with the signature of a guy who endorsed his opponent on the front door 😭
I don’t know why anyone would want Chris Sununu’s endorsement. He is a complete and total RINO! But I must admit that it is funny to watch DeSantis and his “influencers” meltdown over Sununu endorsing Nikki Haley over Rob. Rob spent a year sucking up to Sununu hoping he would endorse him. Another devastating blow to the slimiest and worst Presidential candidate in modern history. It’s over Rob.
DeSimps are in complete meltdown mode because the moronic governor of New Hampshire endorsed Nikki Haley over Rob even though Rob kissed Sununu’s a** so publicly so many times angling for an endorsement. 😂😂😂😂😂😂

"Donald Trump has a lot of bluster and bravado, but despite what his lawyer Alina Habba claims, he is just a huge coward. Bones spurs during Vietnam, in a bunker during a protest, he hides from debates, he's afraid to testify. Real leaders take a stand; trump COWERS."
A complete list of all of the former U.S. Presidents who have stated a desire to be dictator for a day. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. Donald J. trump 46.
"🚨BREAKING: MAGA House Speaker Mike Johnson makes the case for why it is a terrible idea to try to impeach President Joe Biden: ""If you don’t like the president, he goes on a ballot again after four years. We have an election in 11 months. Let the people decide this.” Oops... Mike Johnson was actually talking about Donald Trump in 2019. It bears mentioning that President Biden has not attempted to extort any of our allies, nor has he attempted to incite insurrection, which are the two issues for which Trump was impeached. In fact, many Republicans have already admitted, in private and in public, that there is no evidence of wrongdoing to warrant an impeachment of the President."
I hope election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss get the maximum possible financial damages from Rudy Giuliani for the absolute hell he put them through. And then I hope he loses his license. And then I hope he goes to prison. In THAT order.
"This attack ad from a year ago, created by Mothers Against Greg Abbott, is actually playing out in real time in Texas for Kate Cox. Trump and the Republican party are 100% responsible for this cruel debacle. 🚨Make sure everyone sees this."
"What's crazy is that you can't even say that trump is good at doing crime and hiding it. trump University, trump Foundation, trump Organization -- all closed for fraud. In fact, the ONLY thing he's good at is slapping his name on his failures. Just look at Don Jr."
"If you agree that a six-time bankrupted guy indicted on tax and fraud charges whose Foundation was shut down for fraud should NOT be in charge of America's economy, I suggest you follow us at where we've always known he was unfit, and are fighting to defeat him."
"🚨🚨HUGE BREAKING: Special Counsel Jack Smith has thrown down the gauntlet, taking his case directly to the Supreme Court as he asks them to weigh in on the issue of Donald Trump's claim of ""presidential immunity."" Smith is attempting to keep the March trial date on schedule by having SCOTUS decide once and for all whether Trump is liable for prosecution for crimes he committed while in office. How does this news make you feel?"
"Republican politicians want to control your body, your family, your survival. Democrats believe no politician should deny women reproductive care or choose the timing and size of your families. That’s why freedom is on the ballot in 2024 and why we’ll win! -NP "
"It's hilarious to that people still believe that trump is a good businessman: - He had to declare bankruptcy SIX times, including for a casino. A CASINO!!!! - He paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 so that nobody would know he had sex with her. NOW WE ALL KNOW. - He paid an ""expert"" witness $877,000 to testify in the civil fraud trial where he is accused of overvaluing his assets. The guy testified ""The value of Donald trump's triplex was inflated."" - He inherited a thriving, humming economy from President Obama and left it with 3 million FEWER jobs than it had at his inauguration, the absolute WORST jobs President in American history. And people want that titanic, clueless clod to run the United States economy? NO THANK YOU."
"Sen. Roger Marshall minimizes Trump's dictator threat, says ""I wouldn't overreact to every word he says."" He's already incited insurrection with his words. Underreacting is the problem."
"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who remembers how fearlessly Hillary Clinton testified for 11 hours, while cowardly, punk ass bunker bitch Donald trump is too busy cowering. If you're innocent, you should have no fear."
"REMINDER: Believe it or not, trump could have been much, much worse if not for the “moderate” influences around him checking his insane impulses. If we don't take the threat seriously, he'll be back without sane guardrails. If given the chance, he WILL be a dictator."
"TWEEPS: Do me a favor, please... There is a fake account that is ripping off my likeness and my tweets. It is not me, obviously. Please report > < Thanks!"
"LMAOOO, trump's bargain basement lawyer Alina Habba said that trump will testify tomorrow because he doesn't cower, and he immediately began to cower and will NOT testify. What a total chickenshit."
"Good lord, three quarters played in Vikings vs Raiders, and the score is a total shutout, zero - zero. What the actual f*ck."
"PRO TIP: When a wannabe dictator tells you he wants to be a dictator for a day, believe him. But you better believe he won't stop being a dictator after a day. Believe me."
"I'm not surprised that Elon Musk has allowed Sandy Hook denier Alex Jones back on the site. But I am disappointed. You can support free speech without inviting the worst people you know to spread vile, hateful lies in your space. Alex Jones made millions of dollars inciting harassment of the Sandy Hook parents with his disgusting lies saying their children's deaths was a hoax. Jones caused immeasurable pain and suffering to those parents. If I was one of those parents, I'd see the decision to reactivate Jones' account as a slap in the face and a great big ""f*ck you"" from the owner. At the end of the day, it's his site, he paid for it, so he can do whatever he wants with it. But just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should, and it's a silly cop out to put the responsibility of that decision on a poll dominated by bots and ass-kissing sycophants."
President Biden and Democrats delivered 14 million jobs and made infrastructure investments across America — and we're just getting started! We brought home billions in new funding to California high speed rail that will create jobs and bring us into a clean energy future. -NP

"The idea that anyone would consider to reinstate Alex Jones on this site, who said the deaths of Sandy Hook children was a hoax, is the peak of irresponsibility and stupidity. Aren't there enough disgusting, hateful ghouls on this site already?"
"It's so weird to me that a presidential candidate actually said that he'd ""only"" be a dictator on day one, and he's still a candidate. He's still a candidate who just had another gag order imposed on him, in one of the 91 felony counts against him, because he can't control his impulse to threaten witnesses. Still a candidate after inciting a damn insurrection against America. Still a candidate after being found liable for rape by a judge. Still a candidate after praising Hezbollah for being ""very smart."" I have to say it this way because it's batshit fucking insane, and it's not normal, nor should it ever be. The media's reporting on it like it's just inevitable, what can we do, because he's good for their ratings. His fanatical base is approximately 25% of registered voters, but somehow he still has a chance of winning in 2024. Don't act like any of this is normal, because it's not. Don't take it for granted that you don't have to vote because you live in a blue state, so of course he won't win. Don't assume he'll be convicted. He might be, but you still need to vote for the only person who can beat him: President Biden. Make sure you vote. Make sure everyone you know votes. EVERY VOTE COUNTS. Make sure yours is counted."

Just hire me like. I will learn how to do the rest of the job later
"Hold me accountable yes, but watch your tone."
my DMs closed. I like somebody and they like me. and we be kissing
“if you need me i’m one call away” also me:
No body: My bedroom fan that's been running on high nonstop for 3 years
Me getting in my boyfriend car after studying all the lyrics of his favorite song from the last car ride
me randomly getting a burst of energy before my social battery dies out
Just like this actually
“what makes u happy?”
"Me catching myself saying ""now I need something sweet "" after I eat🤣"
first day of ur period feels like
me finally accepting the fact that i’ll probably be single the rest of my life
how it be fr
me when someone doesn't believe me and they google it and see I'm right
John Mcafee was a 3+ pack a day smoker & had to be put to sleep by a series of shadow governments in his seventies Few
"Can realistically only degrade a few % off your baseline genes no matter how bad you fuck yourself up & gifted ppl have a protection compared to others Elite athletes eating Garbage and partying Joe Rogan took hella punch’s to head & drug experimentation, still 130 iq"
Yup. Real men should always be out with the boys making money so they don’t witness their wife getting railed by the neighbor. A real Chad type shares his wife with the community & let’s the kids grow up with little father presence so they end up ho’s or junkies
"These are the alphas. No deserving man needs to learn how not to get dumped “Be toxic, withdraw attention,” none of this shit is gonna work long term. If you’re a weak mfer she is gonna break ur system. You’re gonna crack under her shit tests eventually. Can’t fake bein alpha"
"There are swaths of men who’ve never had their heartbroken. Have walked away from incompatible women early on. Have taken a swing with only the deserving one & eventually wifed her up No doompill, no resentment of women, living in a naive bliss w their queen"
"Average guy doesn’t have one tbf. If you don’t have talent go all in on being hyper normie Anytime a woman criticizes a man that’s the type of man she’s currently dating atm So bleach ur eyeballs, do goofy shit and ride it till the wheels come off Chicks love love love losers"
Bar a lucky 10% the best u can hope for as an average chimp is a 5 with serious issues If you want a quality wife you have to become a monstrosity she will revere & follow you out of the hands of hades She is out there and needs to be saved
Ur parents won’t tell you this but the good path will leave you with 0 women or a wife The days of being a good husband are gone. Jobs are for women nowadays Mens only option is to lean into their edge
A secret that holds true for every man of distinction is that deep down they are borderline suicidal/depressed the entire time but channel that energy into all facets of life. And it makes them giants. The trick is to never cave into the energy or it’s all she wrote
"Where u stand redefines your past. If the 100th attempt fails again, you're a loser who lost 100 times. If you score that swing, ur a stubborn believer who never gave up. The fathers of winners are tough in hindsight. The fathers of losers, abusive."
Vast majority of problems in life should not be attacked head on. You just obsess & harp on shit and things just start gravitating toward you You’re always on some kind of slope and you just need to keep climbing. Usually 100x of what u want is awaiting u at the top
Obsession really is the powerhouse for the male form. Someone not obsessed has to grind their shoulder to the wheel and they’ll never catch up. Ur subconscious takes over & calibrates for you all the time. 1-2 hours of execution & ur steamrolling everyone
There’s a thing in modernity where men get laid way more when they’re losers. Soon as they make a ton of money & get in shape the women dry up. Cause making big $$ and being shredded screams anxiety. Women like low anxiety men. Takes a ton of skill to strike both.
"You have to stop noticing the problem for it to get better. It’s true on the other end of the spectrum also If you recognize you’re funny, good-looking, charismatic etc u get too invested and eviscerate it’s natural Magic Noticing your own talent is suicide"
If you have a recurring problem with a certain motif in your life you 100% want it to be happening Either justifies and out or gives you validation You absolutely want your problems
Ancient man had zero fucking clue what he even looked like let alone his body weight. He either speared the mammoth or he didn’t. Life in first person POV The advent of the camera led men to live life in 3rd person POV. Deeply feminine and homosexual perspective
The weak & the stupid love to masquerade passively behind bodacious & seemingly righteous causes. They don’t really want to save the world. They want the world to change in hopes that it can save them
All Natural vs. Juicehead: October 14th.
"Logan is so delusional he thinks this makes him look good. It’s actually crazy. Suing someone isn’t a real fighter move. It's a cowardly move. Step down from your moral high ground. People still remember you using a suicide victim for financial gain and clout. Also, be a man and turn on your replies pussy."
I’ll be there fight night everyone can calm down.
Nina running to my room after I knockout her pussy fiancé stone dead.

"Logan bragging about lawsuits again he isn’t built for the fight game, this pussy doesn’t deserve me I’m out."
"Remember when you begged me for a picture, little fan boy? Bitch, if I come to the UFC, I'd tap you in the first round."
"I ain't sayin this shit again. Hoe, you know what it is. It’s a warning shot before I blow up your whole spot. Call me bluffing; I release every fucking thing I got."
Got a brand new Rolex as a gift 🎁 watch below 👇 
If I go to the UFC give me a easy first fight I’ll take Kevin Holland.
"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
"Best part of this is that when she inquired about why this book was being read to Kindergarteners, they told her that they were a “progressive school” and if she had any issues with it then she need not apply."
Friend of mine went to visit an elementary school called Foote School in Connecticut. This is the book they were reading to a kindergarten classroom. Unreal. We are truly facing a crisis of masculinity in this country and it is ever so intentional.

Twitter is not for the faint of heart.
I’m sorry for the aggressive follow up here but has anyone been able to determine what this figuratively or literally means? We can’t just be expected to move on in life. We need to know.
"The way she reacted to the comment about her daughter, you would have thought her daughter was 9 yrs old—not the 25 year old married pediatric nurse that she is. Nikki is just not equipped mentally to deal with what Trump & his family dealt with day in and day out. She’s weak."
Women are more emotional than men. Nikki became shrill and hysterical last night. Vivek worked her up and she couldn’t regain control.
"GOP debate recap: Not only was Vivek the unanimous winner. A star was born today. He shined. He was loose. He was comfortable yet intense. He even gave credit to Desantis and Tim Scott multiple times. A good balance between a fighter, leader and a synergist. He kept going to Desantis on each break and spark a conversation with him. Another Sign of a synergist. He kept giving different perspectives. Changing definition of overdose to terrorist poisoning. He was so captivating tonight that if you watch the replay, you’d notice even his opponents impressed with his answers. Desantis was the most poised I’ve ever seen. He’s super comfortable. And was Presidential. Best I’ve seen him. He was even funny and loose. Nikki Haley was favored to win but she seemed rattled and upset. It’s as if she came with an agenda and Vivek disrupted her. She is by far the best in giving data. But she was a bit off today. Christie didn’t call out Vivek or anyone else like he did in first two debates. Which means he knows this could be his last GOP debate. Tim Scott got a ton of speaking time but I found myself thinking I’m at Church instead of at a debate. Seems like a nice man but way Too bland. Having said that, this was the best of the 3 debates. Great job to moderators. The voters won today."
"I was sitting there in a complete mindfreeze when nikki said this, wondering what I had missed in life that caused this to go so over my head…. 🤔"
"VIVEK: “Do you want a leader from a different generation who's going to put this country first, or do you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels... in which case we've got two of them on stage tonight.”"
Can anyone tell me what on earth this is supposed to mean? What are heels for ammunition and why did she think this would be received as clever?
Who won the debate?
Nobody makes me throw up in my mouth like Neocon Nikki.
Do you know which country you’re currently running for President within? This is becoming insufferable.

When modern day man is in convo w woman he wonders what she thinks about his looks more than the substance of what he says. This is what looking in the mirror did to men. Made them self conscious premadonnas. Mirror is for a 1 second hygiene check & that’s that

"A lifetime of niceness, When you snap once, You won’t be taken seriously Whatsoever. A lifetime of being an asshole When you’re nice once It’ll be the most cherished experience for them. Lesson in there"
"Can’t relate to the stoic types. Every massive loss is a serrated knife to my heart. Every huge win is a champagne shower. Sure, keep an even keel and a hand on the wheel for the people around you. But face the joys and throes of life bare chested as God intended."

"Most men never figure out working on their physique athleticism and health is gearing up for a mission. It’s not a mission in its own right. If you use it for any other purpose than eventually running a mission you become a veritable loser. When the demand for work does eventually strike, and it will, if you can’t let your physique or workouts backslide you will go nowhere in life. The rattling irony is you’re 100x more likely to get everything you wanted in that period where you let it go while ur chasing the big cake than ever before. You’ll lose weight, you’ll lose muscle, you’ll lose some of your looks guaranteed. And you’re far more attractive to the world in this state. Soon as the vanity goes, your stride looks different. So does your aura. You become a monstrosity crafted out of the hands of hades until you complete what you’re called to do. If you never dare to cannibalize everything you just built in your body you never leave hell"
"Best part about being a man is never needing to know how you’re gonna get it done, but knowing you will. No chance of serendipity when you prescript shit Only fools need order. Geniuses lorde over chaos"

"As promised—More information about Audrey Hale, the Watch now: "
"BREAKING: I just got word that two officers are due to be fired over the the release of the pages. Allegedly, the documents were sold by one of the officers. Yesterday I said that I wanted to wait to report on the released pages because while it was a major break, I felt the documents were incomplete and did not paint an accurate picture of what transpired given the amount of evidence we know was collected in the aftermath of the horrific shooting. I am glad I waited. Yesterday evening I was contacted by a source with more concrete information regarding all of details on ‘s many notebooks and what her true motive was. I will be breaking this on my podcast today. Credit where it’s due— this only happened because the Crowder team reopened this conversation in a major way by releasing the initial 3 pages of Audrey’s journal. This was great work which will lead to major answers for parents like myself who live in the community and have been infuriated by the lack of information presented to the public. Stay tuned."
We are all in agreement. Cops did the right thing here. It was an absurdity that this was kept from the public.
Retweeting this so more men can read it. Very powerful and so true.
"Who was targeted? Americans of all political stripes, but especially conservatives: "
"‼️📄 Hours after the shooting, Metro Nashville Police executed a search warrant on Audrey Hales home. They found 20 journals, 6 school yearbooks, writings, hard drives and a suicide note alongside a cache of weaponry which included ammunition, firearms, accessories, and shooting targets. Inventory of seized property:"
"As a mother I disagree. As an advocate against the mental illness that is transgenderism, I disagree. We have to look evil in the face if we want to defeat it. I want to know everything there is to know about a trans person that ruthlessly murders Christian schoolchildren—up to and including the pharmaceutical drugs she was on. Every page of every notebook. Every text message. Everything."
"Holding my comments regarding the because I am unsure if it is in fact the manifesto, or just 3 pages from the shooter’s notebook. My earlier understanding was the that the shooter had a detailed manifesto which spelled out the reasons for the attack which was being withheld? Either way I hope this at the very least puts pressure on the authorities to release everything they have because the public has always had a right to know."
"After 9/11, George Bush and Dick Cheney sent America’s sons and daughters - people my age - to die in the Middle East and racked up $7TN in debt for pointless wars that hurt this country. No-win wars that cost trillions, killed millions & made corrupt politicians billions. They passed the Patriot Act, violated the Constitution & weaponized the justice system. 20 years later later, the Taliban is still in charge in Afghanistan. 20 years later, it’s a hostile anti-American regime running Iraq. And now 20 years later, it’s Dick Cheney 2.0 trying to reclaim the GOP again. That’s the real choice we face in this primary: do you want to rack up trillions more in debt & send our sons and daughters to die fighting someone else’s war in places like Ukraine and the Middle East? As a father, my obligation is to my family - period. And as the next President, my sole obligation will be to the American people - period. Now is our moment for choosing. We can choose the past. Or we can choose the future."

"BREAKING: A DC appeals court has significantly upheld the gag order on trump's federal election case, preventing him from threatening witnesses. Haha, get f*cked, criminal loser."
Fox News' Peter Doocy has never met an anti-Biden storyline he can't run with. But EVEN DOOCY is forced to admit here that the House Oversight Committee is cooking a nothingburger with their Biden impeachment inquiry.
OMG 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
"🚨🚨2024 ELECTION ALERT: ""If you can't beat 'em, cheat 'em"" should be Republicans' new motto as explosive revelations point to a sinister plot by Donald Trump's allies to manipulate the 2024 election. According to a damning report, nine GOP-led states have abandoned the bipartisan Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), leaving the door wide open for potential election interference. The move comes after Trump loyalists, fueled by conspiracy theories, attacked ERIC, with prominent election denier Cleta Mitchell at the forefront of convincing states to embrace the dubious EagleAI software, a risky alternative, says Rolling Stone. David Becker, ERIC's former executive director, warns of dire consequences, stating, “Their voter lists are likely to be significantly less accurate.” The shift increases the likelihood of outdated records and false claims of voter fraud, creating chaos at the polls. It's essentially a MAGA mass voter fraud machine. Becker emphasizes the correlation between faulty voter lists and increased potential for violence, as losers exploit delays and obstacles to falsely cry foul play. Founded in 2012 by Pew Charitable Trusts, ERIC aimed to modernize voter-registration data and eliminate inaccuracies. However, EagleAI, drawing from public data like obituaries and property tax records, enables mass challenges to voters. Georgia's Columbia County, a Republican stronghold, has already embraced EagleAI, raising concerns about potential unlawful list-maintenance activities, as voiced by the state's director of elections, Blake Evans. The crooked machinations surrounding the abandonment of ERIC and the adoption of EagleAI cast a shadow over the integrity of future elections. As Trump's allies exploit loopholes in the electoral system, the risk of chaos, violence, and false claims of stolen elections looms large. This needs to be a MUCH bigger story."

"🚨🚨BREAKING: A former police chief, anti-vaxxer, and yoga teacher has been sentenced to over a decade in prison for the role he played in the January 6th attack at the US Capitol. 56-year-old California resident Alan Hostetter was convicted in July, and was representing himself in the sentencing hearing before he was sentenced by Judge Royce C. Lamberth to 135 months in prison. He must report to prison by January 5, 2024. Hostetter reportedly opted not to fly to Washington DC, in order to be able to ""load his car with weapons."" He loaded multiple hatchets into his car as well as a stun gun and pepper spray. Prosecutors for the DOJ also noted statements he'd made prior to January 6th such as “Choke that city off. Fill it with patriots” and “Put the fear of God into Members of Congress.” Ironically, despite his own admitted and heavily-documented involvement in January 6th, he somehow still believes that January 6th was a ""false flag"" operation. He is another dangerous criminal off the streets who should have stayed home and practiced yoga instead."
"HOLY SH*T, former police chief, insane conspiracy theorist, and January 6th attacker Alan Hostetter was just sentenced to 135 months in prison for his actions on January 6th. Welcome to Findoutsville, right on the southern border of Fuckaroundistan."
"BREAKING: Donald Trump's defense in the $250 million fraud trial just suffered a DEVASTATING blow from his own witness, who said that there was ""no question"" that he inflated the value of his property. Eli Bartov, an accounting professional, testified that records show the disgraced former President boosted the value of his Trump Tower triplex by $100 million between 2011 and 2012. “The price was inflated. There is no question about it,” Bartov said. And then he attempted to claim that the error had more to do with inept blundering on the balance sheet instead of intentional fraud, asserting that Trump would have worked harder to hide fraud if he'd committed it. It should be noted that Trump, who routinely tells easily disprovable lies, neither works hard nor is he capable of or interested in hiding his crimes, which is why he now faces 91 felony counts. The hearing then turned fiery as the Attorney General's counsel objected to Bartov's testimony, saying that his comments exceed his area of expertise and that Bartov was ""hired to say whatever it is they want.” Bartov reportedly EXPLODED in response, saying “You make up allegations that never existed... You should be ashamed of yourself, talking to me like that."" The two sides have broken for lunch."
"My least favorite style of debating is interrupting a person, and then shouting over them while they're giving their response, especially if they let you finish cleanly without interruption first.

"Every few months, Mitt Romney will stand up, take a deep breath, and utter some kind of attempt at defiance in the shadow of trump, pretending to have rediscovered his spine. But Mittens will forever be who he was in this picture: neutered, feckless, impotent, and unable to fully rebuke the guy who transformed his political party into a drunken, back alley knife fight. Maybe Romney is just incredibly out of touch, since all of the millions he and his family has will isolate them from any real harm if trump wrecks the place. Romney offered his opinion on trump's statement that he'd be a dictator ""on day one"" by minimizing its importance: “Sometimes a little baby will spout off all sorts of words that you don’t take either literally or seriously."" That ""little baby"" orchestrated a coup, Mitt. He tried to bury democracy in a shallow grave on January 6th, ffs. Wasn't Mitt in the building when people were smearing feces on the walls, when they were busting windows and doors, and clobbering Capitol Police with fire extinguishers??? He's actually decided to leave the Senate because there's nothing left of what used to be his party. MANY Republican politicians who are unwilling to MAGA-ize themselves are doing the same. I get mad at Romney, that guy who tried (and lost) his bid to beat President Obama, because every now and then he'll say something that sounds responsible, makes sense, and makes me forget he's the guy who tied his dog to the roof of his car. The guy with an elevator for his cars. The guy eating a plateful of crow in this picture with trump, right after swallowing his pride to beg for a position. That's who Mitt Romney is. He's not built for taking down wannabe dictators. That's why we have a Biden-led Democratic party. We'll finish the damn job. 💙🇺🇸"
"I'm getting pretty sick and fucking tired of the media playing this stupid game asking why is President Biden running for reelection. 1. He's the sitting President. 2. He's having a VERY successful first term. 3. Presidents usually run for reelection. 4. He handily beat the GOP frontrunner. How about stop trying to kneecap Biden, and get after the guy with 91 felony charges who says he will be a dictator on day one and he'll go after people in the media critical of him? You all might be interested in a horse race for ratings, but we're not. You did this bullshit in 2016. This is not a game. STOP IT."
TODAY: Democrats tried to pass an assault weapons ban. Republicans blocked it. ALSO today: multiple victims of gun violence are reported at UNLV. Thoughts and prayers are not working. VOTE THOSE NRA LACKEYS OUT.
"What is at risk in the upcoming election? The former president already said that the the Affordable Care Act was his target. People have to know when we talk about Democracy being at stake, it's your freedom to have health care; to have coverage for pre-existing medical conditions; to have reproductive choice."
"This should be a bigger story in the media. 👇 Donald is using tens of millions of dollars of donor money to pay not only his lawyers, but the LAWYERS OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES AND CO-DEFENDANTS. Below I will explain how this can be ILLEGAL. The Save America PAC has paid nearly $37 million to over 60 law firms and attorneys since 2022. But Why would Donald pay for witnesses’ legal fees? Typically the DOJ charges the underlings in the hopes they turn on the big fish. But here's the question. If the PAC is paying for their legal bills, does that make them less likely to turn on Donald? There's more! PACs are NOT PERMITTED to use donor funds to benefit campaigns. How does keeping Donald out of jail not benefit his campaign? 🤔 I have some thoughts bout how to make this illegal. It starts with raising hell with the FEC. Are you in? 👇 For detailed analysis on this shocking claim and what it means for Donald and the GOP, please reserve your free spot for my newsletter. The link is in my bio!T"
"Donald Trump told Sean Hannity he'd be a dictator ""only on day one."" His enablers like Steve Bannon try to deny it, but we've all seen this movie before. He just said the fascist part out loud. There's no room in our democracy for a dictator. Not even for a day."

"Thanks for asking , the answer is simple: President Trump was the best friend Jewish people have had in the White House in modern times. 1. The Trump Administration recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. The move was a significant step in acknowledging Jerusalem as the Jewish people's historical and spiritual capital. 2. The Trump Administration brokered the historic Abraham Accords. These peace agreements have led to increased cooperation between Israel and Arab nations. 3. President Trump officially recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 4. President Trump withdrew us from the catastrophic Iran Nuclear Deal. 5. The Trump Administration signed an executive order in 2019 that extended Title VI protections against discrimination to Jewish students on college campuses which is more important than ever today. "

How long before the DeSantis campaign asks for a refund from the $95k man?"
Trump surpasses 50% support in the Iowa caucus! Cue the DeSimp meltdowns… it’s so over for Tiny D and company. Karen Reynolds endorsement couldn’t save Rob. Bob Vander Putz couldn’t save Rob. No one can save Rob. Trump 2024.

"One down. Two to go. This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most “prestigious” higher education institutions in America. This forced resignation of the president of is the bare minimum of what is required. These universities can anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, funding, and overall leadership and governance. and , do the right thing. The world is watching. In the case of , Dr. Gay was asked by me 17x whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard’s code of conduct. She spoke her truth 17x. And the world heard. In the case of , Dr. Kornbluth answered the question. “If targeted at individuals, not public statements” ie dehumanizing the Jewish people in her antisemitic answer."
"Listen to the Memer of Congress, , folks. The Iowa caucus is only for Iowans!"
Please don't break the law by going to another state to vote if you are not a resident there.
Last night a Presidential candidate’s spouse encouraged out of state residents to participate in the Iowa caucus. The Iowa GOP responded making it very clear that the Iowa caucus is ONLY for Iowans. Posting this so residents of and Florida aren’t confused by her comments!
Let’s protect election integrity ! The Republican Party of Iowa has confirmed you must be a LEGAL RESIDENT OF IOWA and bring a photo ID with you to participate in the . The Trump campaign has this right and 40 pt lead is 🔥!

"Went to bed while listening to Brute space He speaks with so much conviction he could tell me seed oils are good and I’d believe it One of the best speakers on this platform, a brutally honest realist Something more people need "
brute is one of the best speakers I’ve heard. Captivating 0 filler words concise. This fool could be a $100m personal brand overnight if he went all in on content. Take over internet & whoop goggins types asses. 0 doubt.
Living from the heart is the essence of masculinity. Comes with its own preset conditions. Can’t be punctured or influenced. The head is female. Needs input to parse. Women live in their heads men live in their hearts. Sit n think about it. Royally true
"The person you want to become is going to cost you people, spaces, relationships, and material things. Gotta choose the person you’re becoming every time"
Anger doesn’t get the credit it deserves. It’s innovative as fuck. Blind anger is suicide but is so blind anything. Anger is indicative of divine favor. It’s aristocratic. God sends his mortal favorites into a fury to accomplish his mission
The reality about changing who you are
There’s an awesome torpor you can find yourself in from not dislodging very *minor* tasks that pile up on you from the back of your head. Literally not getting ur car washed for 6 months can change ur personality & put a dark cloud over ur head. Clears the minute u handle it
"You must die before you can truly live in the sense that until the majority of your worst fears have come true & you’ve beat them you never know what kind of substance you’re made of. Should always feel like you’re on borrowed time, only then can you enjoy everything"

What science won’t tell you is all these dudes were roided out of their minds during this siege. Even the pudgy dude with the shotgun. Guaranteed every officer had a short spurt of 1200-1500 test during the raid. Lesson in there
I once said working out should be the least fascinating component of your life but it’s true for work and business too. The $$ talk on here is so dull and boring. Everyone runs a fucking business. Work and $ is the baseline What can you perceive and articulate outside of that
"90% of the dread in the service industry comes from being forced to serve unimportant people. The second a *perceived* to be important person needs help, even the laziest most existentially tortured employee will spring to life to serve them Lesson in there"
What no one hyped up on success porn will tell you is that almost all high achievers dread what they do. The best of the best despise their craft but hate & love are very close. They’re compelled to do it anyway. COMPELLED. Sisyphus is and always will be the apt metaphor
It should be obvious at this point lifting weights is all about strengthening the hull of the ship so you can take more damage from life without flinching All it gives is a larger reservoir to deplete as needed
"No deliberating. Should know exactly what you want at all times. Walk in any store bang bang, know the paint color, the brand, the appliance, out in minutes. Leave the not knowing what you want for the birds"
When the novelty of living in a certain location wears off you gotta ask yourself if it’s a reflection that you’ve stopped growing as a person. And I guarantee you it is

"Casey DeSantis’ call for wide spread voter fraud in the Iowa Caucus has made the front page of the Des Moines Register. Yikes. Thank you for setting the record straight, !"
"President shares a statement from on the political persecution of Trump happening in NY. So true, Elise!"
I’m a firm believer in ELECTION INTEGRITY. That is why I find Casey DeSantis’ call for out of staters to vote in the Iowa caucus abhorrent! She should be ashamed of herself!
The DeSantii’s call for mass voter fraud is disturbing and quite frankly disqualifying.
"We enjoyed an incredible Texas Youth Summit in 2023, and we are planning for and excited for more events in 2024. Check out this promo video featuring many of the biggest names in politics! Stay tuned for big announcements, and support our efforts at ."
Team DeSantis has started to realize that their burner accounts and bots on social media can’t vote in the Iowa caucus so they are now encouraging out of staters to descend upon Iowa to illegally vote. These people are worse than most democrat politicians. Swampy!
It’s honestly pathetic and disgusting that Casey DeSantis was openly calling for mass voter fraud in the Iowa caucus because her loser husband is 30% behind .
Casey Desantis calling for out of staters to join the caucus in iowa …she gives the cheating left a run for their money in this one

TikTok is fostering anti-Semitism and Meta is being sued for enabling child sex abuse on Facebook and Instagram. Yet the media attacks and advertiser boycotts are coming for X and . Apparently it's a bigger crime to let people speak freely than to harbor child porn.
Imagine visiting all 99 Iowa counties and spending tens of millions of dollars there but you still need to beg people from out of state to come illegally participate in the caucuses because you have next to no support. 😂😭
Wow sure sounds like Casey DeSantis is openly calling for illegal voting in the Iowa caucuses due to her husband being 30% behind . Sketchy!!!!
"Biden is the wannabe dictator, not Trump!"
"“How Trump Proved Experts Wrong on Israel: The Liberal Street, not the Arab Street, is the problem” Excellent piece about how and were bringing peace to the middle East and how the left screwed it all up. "
The accuracy of is scary good.
"Many Democrat politicians like to compare Hunter Biden to Don Jr, Ivanka, and Jared, even though there is NO COMPARISON. Don, Ivanka, and Jared, are all good people who were accomplished and successful long before President Trump got into office. Hunter is a degenerate crackhead who solely made money selling access to his father."

Reinventing cable. Just like Uber reinvented taxis. All these “disruptors” or “innovators” do is undercut an existing industry until they force it into a chokehold. Then they rebuild the preexisting business model sans worker protections like residuals and employment contracts.

Suffering will do fuck all for you if it’s not on your terms. If you suffer at the behest of obligatory subservience there is ZERO virtue in that. If you suffer through heroic transcendence in the drivers seat it is. Ur gonna suffer either way. One builds character
Your alter ego is the voice you suffocate when you work a job you hate & you repress it & stuff it down That voice is trying to free you & that’s the wrong kind of suffering Suffering out of helplessness doesn’t build men. Suffering through agency and control does

In conversation most people examine themselves from the eyes of the person they’re talking to. Living in 3rd person derails your grasp of everything. The only way to live is from the inside out. First person point of view is where all the heavy impact emanates from
"A woman who is submissive can only be to the man she chose and in turn chooses her. She has to be dominant to all else bc if not, how powerful is he really? If she submits to everyone and everything…he’s worthless"
You’ll always be behind the person you keep checking on. While ur looking over your shoulder and theirs they’re working. Master your lane and what’s going on anywhere else won’t matter. There’s enough space and money out here. If you’re good at what you do you’ll get chosen
"A cavalier attitude toward life is akin to 8 figs in the bank, an extra 6 inches of height, bulging shoulders, 8 PHD’s & an aural blast radius stronger than the sun Nothing skirts the correct attitude in life. Can get treated eerily similar to a billionaire if you cultivate it"

The Israeli children are in fact missing and it’s abhorrent to tear down posters of them. There is no cap on posters so if you’d like to post the New York children that are missing or any other missing children worldwide you should do it. You have a right to advocate for causes you care about everywhere. I wouldn’t tear down a poster of a missing Haitian child because “this is not Haiti”. Missing children anywhere is sad. I don’t get why this is hard for some people to understand.
"I always defend speech, even the kind I disagree with. I do not think America should send money overseas to fight foreign wars and I never accept the lies from politician that we do so in an effort to “spread democracy”. Activists pulling down signs of missing/dead Israeli children is positively abhorrent and evil. I cannot comprehend it. Activists glossing over dead Palestinian children as if their lives mean less is similarly abhorrent and evil—I cannot comprehend it. Genocide, no matter which government expresses its aim, is always indefensible. Protect civilians. Fight terrorism. These are my views."
"And to those of you who will inevitably attempt to further smear me, threaten me or in utmost hysteria—attempt to destroy what you perceive to be my livelihood because I will not acquiesce to your radicalism— let me remind you: you cannot destroy what you did not create. I lived through more before the age of 7 than most of you will likely ever endure in your lifetime. Your mean tweets make me laugh."
"I agree with Queen Rania’s assertion that antisemitism is being weaponized in order to silence critics and bully people into compliance. That Charlie Kirk, Elon Musk, and Thomas Massie have recently been smeared as antisemites is proof of this charge. This is the same behavior we saw from Black Lives Matter activists when the threat of being labeled a racist or a white supremacist was being used to shut down legitimate questions about the funding and intentions of the organization, which in time proved to be fraudulent. I have never been a person that is fearful to state the truth and to call out the people and organizations that are engaging in silencing tactics—even when the cost of doing so meant I was caricatured by my own community as a “race traitor.” We have a right to hear any and every political debate, free from the threat of smears. My position on this has not and will not shift, ever. More speech. Not less."
We sent tens of thousands of Ukrainians to slaughter for nothing as we lined the pockets of random oligarchs with billions of dollars and now we’re just memoryholing the whole thing and moving along.

I wake up every morning so excited that I will meet my second son/third-born child this month. Indescribable feeling of happiness. Children are a gift from the Lord. They are a reward from Him.
"30,000 children of illegal migrants entered schools in NYC in September. And the numbers are only growing. The cost to the taxpayer of education at public schools in NYC is $30,000 per child. So that’s almost $1 billion just there. For one year. Not accounting for language and special needs. Eric Adams probably won’t be speaking so bluntly after the DOJ scared him this week as he was on his way to DC to ask Biden to help. But this is what he said when the schools were being overwhelmed a few weeks ago: “Never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to. I don’t see an ending to this. Now we’re getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they’re going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City.” ."
Okay this was indeed a special western propaganda moment. 😂😂 Also Brad Paisley singing in Kiev.
People become so incensed when they realize they’ve overused smears and they no longer hold any power over people. “bUt I sAid you WeRe a racIst hOmopHobe antiSemiTic transPhObe HoLocAust DeNier iSlamapHobe! Why won’t you do what I command?!” Because you’re not a wizard—you’re a clown behind a curtain and your words don’t scare anyone anymore.
True. They media did play the “everyone who disagrees with Zelensky taking cash from American taxpayers is an antisemite” card but that was short lived. 😂
My favorite part of this movie was when celebrities where flying over to meet Zelensky in the middle of a war 🎬
"Let’s reflect before it’s all over. What was your favorite part of the western Ukraine propaganda machine? I will forever miss the Ghost of Kyiv, but also the press telling us that Putin had cancer and only mere weeks to live was also strong. Plus Zelensky wearing fake military fatigues everywhere as he begged to attend the Oscars and the Grammy’s will forever hold a place in my heart. 🤡🤡🤡🤡"
Oh look— our money laundering operation is coming to an end. Time to go find all the warmongers who told you we were fIghTing FoR dEmoCraCy and that holding any opinions against this obvious farce of a moral crusade was uNAmEriCan. Because only “PuTiN pUpPeTs” didn’t want to sent billions overseas to enrich corrupt Zelensky and his goons. It really is clown world out there. 🤡

"Autocratic MAGA stooges Steve Bannon and Kash Patel brazenly expose their plans for trump to rule by revenge if he wins in 2024. ""Yes, we are going to come after the people in the media."" Nothing about helping Americans. Just straight up retribution against critics. This is what's at stake. 🚨Make sure EVERYONE sees this."

"HISTORICALLY UNFIT: It was revealed by former Trump White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah Griffin that Trump once demanded a staffer be ""executed"" for leaking extremely embarrassing info about him. Griffin, who noted on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump is ""historically unfit,"" has not been timid in her criticism of her former boss. She added that he is the only former President to be denounced by his former Chief of Staff, Defense Secretary, National Security Advisor, and more. During a recent airing of ""The View,"" Griffin revealed that Trump learned that a staffer leaked a story about his retreating to a bunker during the George Floyd protests and, in an Oval Office meeting with 12 other staffers, he said that person should be executed. ""He's used that terminology with Gen. Milley. I cannot set off enough alarm bells about how dangerous he is and that he must be stopped at all costs,"" Griffin warned. The White House would later release a statement that Trump wasn't hiding in the bunker, just inspecting it."

"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: After nine months in a pointless blockade preventing military promotions from advancing, Senator Tommy Tuberville has finally backed down, lifting his embargo. The Alabama Senator was jeopardizing America's military readiness in an ill-advised political stunt, objecting to a Pentagon policy allowing service members to travel for abortion care. The caveat on his relinquinshed hold is that he will continue to block promotions for Four Star Generals, because the selfish Senator can't possibly be expected to give up the entire spotlight. Meanwhile, thou9gh, almost 400 service members will finally be able to move forward with logistical plans related to their new positions and responsibilities while keeping America safe. How does this news make you feel?"

"INSANE: The Speaker of the House, MAGA Mike Johnson, just admitted that Republicans are blurring out the faces of January 6th rioters in recently-released video to prevent them from being prosecuted. Isn't that obstruction of justice?"
"Donald Trump was the President in 2020. There was no ""Biden White House"" in 2020, so it couldn't have ""killed"" the Hunter Biden story before the 2020 election as Ronna McDaniel claims. The Biden Derangement Syndrome is staggering."
"Good morning and Happy Tuesday to everyone who disagrees with most of Liz Cheney's policies as a conservative Republican, but agrees with her 100% when she says she ""will never vote for Donald trump"" because ""He is a completely unfit man for office."" Country over party. 🇺🇸"

"Perhaps no single news organization has done more damage to America than Fox News, whose parroting of Trump's ""big lie"" helped enable a coup. But one $787 million settlement later, now they're fact checking him. Fox News can't save us, but they can stop the damage."
"You know what's great about President Biden? He's created 14 million jobs, signed the biggest ever infrastructure bill, brought back manufacturing and lowered insulin costs. He hasn't asked for donations for lawyers fees, and hasn't said fake news once. 😎"
Name this awful musical group. Best one wins. 🏆
"🚨🚨Rare ""W"" for Fox News: Fox News Host Arthel Neville cut away from a Trump rally to fact check him on the 2020 election. Lessons learned: $787 million. Saving democracy: priceless."
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: if you want to make our southern border safe, a wall and stupid hateful slogans won't do it. We need COMPREHENSIVE immigration reform, and it must be bipartisan. Stop keeping this issue alive as a boogeyman to rile up the base."
"If you're fed up with Republican fear-mongering and lies about the border, I strongly suggest you follow us at where we judge Republicans by the votes they cast AGAINST America's best interests."
"OMG, GREAT IDEA 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Secure, affordable health care, home care and child care are a big part of families' kitchen table budget priorities. That's why Democrats will ALWAYS fight back against threats to our lives and livelihoods and vows to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act. -NP "
"Thin-skinned Trump lashes back at DeNiro: Former President Donald Trump unleashed a furious response to actor Robert De Niro's recent criticism at the Gotham Awards ceremony. De Niro, angered by the omission of his own prepared anti-Trump comments from the teleprompter during his speech, defiantly read them from his phone, highlighting Trump's alleged thousands of lies. On Trump's Truth Social platform, the Republican 2024 front-runner retaliated, dubbing De Niro a ""total loser."" Trump questioned De Niro's acting prowess, claiming it had greatly diminished, and ridiculed him for using a teleprompter for his ""foul and disgusting language."" Trump's Truth Social post reads: ""Robert De Niro, whose acting talents have greatly diminished, with his reputation now shot, must even use a teleprompter for his foul and disgusting language, so disrespectful to our Country. He has become unwatchable both in movies, and with the FOOLS that destroyed the Academy Awards, bringing them from one of the top shows in the Country to a Low Rated afterthought. De Niro should focus on his life, which is a mess, rather than the lives of others. He has become a total loser, as the World watches, waits, and laughs!"" As of now, De Niro has not responded to Trump's latest comments. However, during the awards ceremony, De Niro had mercilessly criticized Trump, particularly highlighting the alleged 30,000 lies and referring to him as a ""charlatan."" It should also be noted that Trump himself uses a teleprompter all the time, and frequently reads it poorly. He has also failed to win an Emmy, while President Obama was awarded one, and Robert DeNiro has two Oscar Awards."
BREAKING: Doug Burgum has ended his 2024 Republican campaign for President. ALSO Breaking: WHO?
"Disgraced former President Trump telling Iowa supporters they should go to heavily-populated urban areas like Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta and intimidate voters of color. This is disgusting."
"LMAO, the party of ""personal responsibility"" finds no fault in Mike Lindell's baseless and debunked claims of election fraud, and blames the man they call ""Sleepy Joe"" for Lindell's unhinged downfall. You can't make this stuff up."
"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who agrees that it's bad enough that trump incited an insurrection and stole classified secrets, but his intention to reinstate his Muslim ban is disqualifying. He must never set foot in the White House ever again."
"When Republicans try to say Democrats don't care about the border, remind them that House Republicans voted against the border funding bill, including $7.2 billion for border patrol operations, and $65 million for 300 border patrol agents. The GOP is full of shit."
"I'll never forget the time Senator Lindsey Graham shed tears talking about Joe Biden, saying ""If you can't admire Joe Biden as a person, you got a problem."
"2023 has been the Year of the Union Worker — and women in the labor movement are leading the way. We must save our country, our Democracy and fairness in our system — and unions are key to meeting this moment. We don't agonize, we organize — and we unionize! -NP "
"I know there are folks upset with President Biden's Middle East policy and are threatening to withhold their vote. They will need to work through their anger. Meanwhile, it's our job to make the case no matter how angry they are, trump will be much worse. It's not even close."
"If you agree that we cannot afford any purity or perfection tests with the real threat of trump in play, then I suggest you follow us at where we recognize that the 2024 election is a binary choice between Democratic democracy and trump fascism."
"Good morning and Happy Sunday to everyone who is 100% convinced that President Biden is better in every way than trump, and we can't allow perfect to be the enemy of good in 2024. I'm committed to get out the vote. ARE YOU?"
THEY FINALLY ADDED CARDI B TO THE GAME

"Imagine being told you have to go somewhere or go to jail. You don't get told where (it's usually very far), you don't get to see what the place is like, and you can't take any of your stuff. Also, there's no housing, so in 3 months, when your stay is up, you'll be kicked out."
"The only thing that solves homelessness is supportive, permanent housing. And the truth is, we already have thousands of empty units that are kept off the market. Vacancy tax now."

"You know why President Biden says “Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative?” Because he's not perfect. You may not agree with 100% of his positions, but I guarantee you'll agree more with him than with trump. And that's the choice. It's not complicated."

"Good morning and Happy Saturday to everyone who is curious how Republicans will justify expelling George Santos for lying and corruption, but will give trump the presidential nomination with 91 felony indictments for lying, stealing, corruption, and insurrection."
"The Moms for Liberty “scandal” is so strange. It's only a scandal because their dumb anti-LGBTQ ways say that being gay is wrong. It's nobody's business who you love and who you make love to. Just admit you're a hypocrite, denounce DeSantis, and get back to your throuple."
I just learned that George Santos will NOT be eligible for a pension for his time in the House. CRIME DOES NOT PAY!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I'm old enough to remember when George Santos threatened to spill the tea about all those members of Congress if they voted him out. Things could get interesting. 🍿👀

"Speaking of extremely corrupt people being removed from public service, why does Clarence Thomas still have a seat on SCOTUS? Serious question."

"🚨NEWS: Marjorie Taylor Greene is having a fit because Rep. Maxine Waters called her out on having taken a PPP loan, saying Rep. Waters is both ""too old"" and somehow doesn't enough ""life experience"" to judge others. Greene posted on X: ""Maxine Waters is attacking me for taking a PPP loan (like so many had to), before I was a member of congress, when the tyrannical government shut us all down. Maxine is 85 yrs old and has held government office since 1976!!! She has no idea what it’s like to meet payroll and keep a business running."" But the real issue here is that Greene had her $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven, while hypocritically voting AGAINST student loan forgiveness. In fact, her criticism of student loan forgiveness sounded exactly like this: “For our government just to say, you know, ‘Ok, well your debt is completely forgiven,’ … it’s completely unfair,” Greene said in her best ""forgiveness-for-me, not-for-thee"" tone. Greene isn't the only millionaire to have her PPP loans forgiven, but she is the loudest and one of the most hypocritical when it comes to those less fortunate getting an assist from the government."
"Republicans are fixated on denying LGBTQ folks basic human rights to exist. Despite being the party of small government, Republicans in 12 states passed laws against drag shows, sodomy, and even being gay in public. DeSantis says ""don't say gay?"" We say Don't Say GOP in 2024."
Matt Gaetz after seeing George Santos expelled
"I have mixed feelings with George Santos being expelled. I was licking my chops at the thought of being able to make Santos' corruption the face of the GOP. Now I'll just have to settle for trump's corruption, insurrection, and incompetence as the face of the GOP. Oh well. 😏"
"If you're glad to see corruption FINALLY being held accountable as George Santos is expelled from Congress, then I strongly suggest you follow us at where we believe that if you lie and steal, you do NOT deserve to represent constituents in ANY district."
"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: George Santos has just been expelled from the House of Representatives, by an overwhelming two-thirds majority bipartisan vote. The number of Representatives has officially dropped by one to 434. It is unclear whether he will be forcefully removed from the premises by the Sergeant of Arms. How does this news make you feel?"
"HOLY SH*T, the U.S. House of Representatives has just voted to EXPEL George Santos! Only 5 members of Congress have been expelled in history."
"In a real fight, if I couldn't beat , and in the same night with no breaks in between, I'd retire and delete all my social media accounts. Either way, the PPV revenue would go to the fans. What does everyone think?"

The Pauls might cheat at everything, but let's get one thing straight, Logan: you can pop all the steroids you want, but you can't inject heart."

"A few things most Republicans don't know about Hunter Biden, that he: - is a Yale educated lawyer - is a successful entrepreneur/venture capitalist - was appointed 5 yr on Amtrak Board - as VP - by President George W. Bush in 2006 - is a Humanitarian: most people are unaware that: Hunter Biden was Chairman of the Board of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., from 2011 to 2015. Which supports the work of the UN World Food Programme, which has HUGE impact. While Chairman, Hunter Biden helped increase funding 60 percent in five years - to more than $2 billion. $2 billion. That's a lot of starving people fed! And just for fun, let's see how many horrible comments are made by people who clearly didn't read this. There's always a few. Kinda wish they would read it though. Hunter Biden is an inspiring person. This is only a few small things."
"This debate was painful to watch, with all of Pudding Fingers' yelling over Newsom. In some ways, DeSantis is even worse than trump, because he's ""smarter"" than trump, but somehow LESS human."
"If you agree that Gavin Newsom totally thrashed Ron DeSantis in this debate, I suggest you follow us at where we know that DeSantis' fascist tendencies would be a nightmare for America."
Governor Gavin Newsom: Biden will be reelected. trump will be rejected. AMEN. 🙏
"What part of ""abortion should be up to the mother and her doctor"" do you not understand, Hannity? Ron DeSantis banned abortion at six weeks, before they even know they're pregnant. It's NOBODY'S business except the mother and her doctor."
Ron DeSantis is getting pummeled so badly he's resorted to screaming on top of Governor Newsom's voice. Pathetic behavior for a robot.
"Governor Newsom is beating Ron DeSantis about the head with Bidenomics, and all Boots McPuddin' can do is smile awkwardly."
"Y'all wanna see a body? Governor Newsom: ""There's one thing we have in common, neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024."" 💀💀💀"
Anyone else have a feeling that Gavin Newsom will DESTROY DeSantis in their debate tonight? 🤚
"This is INCREDIBLE: Rep. Stacey Plaskett BRILLIANTLY schools Jim Jordan about the hypocrisy of chairing a weaponization committee, but not being interested in Trump's open threats to weaponize the government."
"What do you notice about this picture of Lauren Boebert, Anna Paulina Luna, and Dave Chappelle?"
"I believe in free speech. I also believe in consequences. I remember as a kid, I'd see one guy tell another guy his mother was a prostitute, and then I'd watch that dude get his ass kicked in. There was no law preventing that guy from disrespecting the other one's mom, but he found out about consequences. I remember walking through certain department stores when I was older, I'd become aware that for absolutely no reason, I was being followed by store employees -- even though I was dressed in my work clothes, at the time a suit and tie. That was the sort of thing you became accustomed to, being treated with glaring suspicion, some places were less obvious about it than others. But I decided I didn't like being treated like that, so I stopped spending my money there. That store was free to treat me the way they wanted to, and I was free to take my business elsewhere. Consequences. Imagine you've been going to a certain restaurant for years, bringing family and friends, and then suddenly there's new management. The new management decides that they want to allow Nazis to dine there, and then allow those Nazis to be disruptive and make other customers feel unsafe with their behavior. If you and other customers decide to leave, because they feel unsafe, would you blame the customers? You can't blame the customers for that. Change your behavior, or lose business. Consequences. If you're telling a business owner that they're doing something you don't like, and their answer is to go f*ck yourself if you don't like it, then the customer isn't killing the business, the owner is. Free speech allows the owner to say that. Free market allows the consequences of the customer deciding to take their business elsewhere. Even a ""genius"" billionaire should know."
"It's bizarre to me that Matt Gaetz believes that ""if George Santos is convicted, then he ought to be expelled,"" but if trump is convicted, he's all-in for him to occupy the highest office in America. Make that make sense."
"George Santos is such a slimy, sleazy member of Congress, it would serve Republicans right if they are unable to expel him from Congress. Maybe let him be the albatross around Republicans' necks for all of 2024. ""GOP: We're pro-corruption!"" or something."

"Congratulations to Jeb Bush, he will no longer be remembered as the guy who ran the worst Presidential campaign of all time. Ron DeSantis will now be remembered for that. Big win for Jeb!"
If the Dem Party had a time machine
And now...Ron's inner thoughts. h/t: 
"We successfully bullied desantis out of wearing his heels. If memers can bully desantis out of wearing his favorite shoes, imagine what Xi could make this guy do… Not fit to serve! Trump 2024!"
It’s so over 😂🤣
A survey done by and found that over 60% of America's businesses are lowering/canceling Christmas bonuses because of inflation caused by Bidenomics. Our country is in serious trouble. Trump can’t come back soon enough. 
"Prison for a Meme: They Want Us All Silenced and Locked Up, Douglass Mackey Speaks Out! Many of you if you were following online, may know him as Ricky Vaughan and outspoken original political Memer. Now they want to throw him in jail! Tonight 6pm! "
"🚨The Committee is opening a formal investigation into the learning environments, policies, and disciplinary procedures at Harvard, UPenn, & MIT. This should be a notice to every university that the targeting of Jewish students on campus will not be tolerated. "
Things that make you go 🤔
"🔥🔥 is launching an investigation into woke, America last universities. Let’s go"
"🚨 After this week’s unacceptable testimony from , , and presidents, the Education Committee is launching an official Congressional investigation including substantial document requests and compulsory measures, including subpoenas to those universities and others. "
Thank you ! MAGA!
What a clown show 😂😂😂
"RINO literally once compared not wearing a mask to picking your nose in public: ""LaRose said he is strongly recommending masks...He characterized refusing to wear a mask into a public polling place as rude, unmannerly and, like picking one's nose, ""just gross."
: Donald Trump won. Vivek came in 2nd. Desantis/Nikki tied for 3rd.
He’s clearly on drugs
"Donald Trump already won tonight’s debate by not showing up. The pretenders should stop wasting everyone’s time. Drop out, endorse Trump, and focus on defeating crooked Joe."
"I like to inverse this idea and say that she knew beautiful, sexy women can also be evil and easily bribed"
"I once did a show at a music venue for an audience who wanted to see music, while I was opening for the band the producer asked me to do another 45 minutes and I shook my head no"
Why does it have human eyes
"A memory I genuinely hold dear in my heart is one summer I lost a pair of sandals when I was living in a house with eight women. Years later, in a completely different city 3,000 miles away, I ran into a friend from from that house who had the sandals on her feet."
Girl on my flight is reading Attached (the co dependency workbook) and using the prompts in it to hit on the guy next to her. Queen …
Bought 30 minutes of inflight wifi three separate times and the guy next to me told me to get it together
Most beautiful girl I ever dated had a hairless cat. And I think beautiful women are just kind of villain coded Like That
"For unhoused neighbors needing emergency shelter from the storm: Our Office has contacted every emergency shelter on this list. (We were unable to reach North Hollywood Rec Center) As of 1:40pm today, these shelters have bed availability."
Texting the group chat to ask who feels mentally present enough to be my emergency contact while I’m abroad
"“In Finland, the # of homeless people has fallen sharply. Those affected receive a small apartment & counselling with no preconditions. 4 out of 5 people affected make their way back into a stable life. And all this is CHEAPER than accepting homelessness.” "
"Maybe not the pay-to-play cults like NIXIVM but the labor based cults where they make you work, or like the Sarah Lawrence sex cult"
I have a theory that a major reason people fall into cults is because they need a cheap place to live
I think a franchise should mean someone different gets to write or direct each new movie. Like I want Greta Getwig’s fast and the furious. Christopher Nolan’s Magic Mike.
"Right now a few dozen volunteers are mobilizing to prepare for the hurricane rains about to hit LA this weekend. We're buying tarp, tents, ponchos, + plastic bags so our unhoused neighbors can stay dry + so they can keep their stuff dry. Ways you can help: 🧵"
"In a comedy room, we're often split into two separate rooms, one working on story, one working on a rewrite. Let's say you have 12 writers, 6 in each room. But actually 2 writers are off on script this week. And also, 2 writers are on set. And the showrunner is in post today..."
There is a VERY popular compost group in LA I have been trying to join their free events for months

Life is all about leaning into your natural fate. Letting the chips fall where they may. All misery comes from trying to interfere with your destiny. Doesn’t matter how it ends. Your job is to steer yourself in the direction of fate
"Know how losers respond to failure? They reward themselves for it. Descend into porn, drugs, gross food as punishment for being rejected Know how winners respond to failure? Tighten it up. Eat even better, be even more militant about staying on course than they were before"
"Very few people live in a way where they experience anything resembling shock, or astonishment , or exasperation. What looks like magic occurs on a daily basis if you’re living right. If you’re not bewildered by the insanity of life every single day you’re Already dead"
"Quality of life is 100% a product of how many lives u can squeeze into one Tons of people have devastated portfolios worth more than you’ll make in 50 years in a single day, had more fiery love affairs in a month than you’ll ever have combined And. They. Still. Kept. It. Movin"
"If your first instinct when you run into a setback is to stop lifting, stop eating well, stop working on your goals, throw yourself in the trash then your reasons for doing all those things was just to look like the best. You never wanted to be the best."
Every woman ubiquitously loves popping your blackheads cause it awakens their instincts to extract shrapnel/slugs from you after war
Things should be going very very wrong on the daily if you’re challenging yourself adequately. To the point of surreal absurdity. Then you troubleshoot. And when you win you’re the calmest you’ve ever been
"Many dudes have made it into their 20’s without ever knowing the feeling of going berserk. Not at a project, not at the gym, zero Frenzy. Internet turned them into voyeurs. Life is a giant museum where they can only look never touch"
"The high spillage lifestyle is a major determinant of high quality of life. Should be hemorrhaging capital to awaken the fight response to generate more. Losing $400 hoodies, overpaying for shit, never bargaining or haggling things down. Wealth really begins in the mind"
You bore a hole in the fabric of reality when you order an $11 orange juice at a raw juice shop and they say they don’t have change for a hundred. You give them the hundred and say keep the change. Simple
I remember how seriously boomers took report cards. It was a life or death moment for them when urs came in the mail. Turns out the kids with all the bad grades ended up starting all the businesses & accelerating in the real world
"Honestly if I ever had to interview someone for ANY position, I’d simply hop in the passenger seat and tell them to go for a drive. No words spoken. I’d know everything I need to know in 15 minutes"

 you have to see this. Unbelievable.
I can say honestly that I’ve never been more proud or more haunted by any interview I’ve ever conducted than this one here. Children being influenced on tik-tok to permanently deform their bodies is the greatest evil we are fighting today. Please— everyone watch this and share. Thank you Briana for your bravery in this most difficult and personal conversation. 
"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can’t believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state."
"In short— If the blanket statement that genocide is wrong upsets you in any way, then you need to check yourself. I said exactly what I meant and I won’t be backing down or apologizing or further clarifying this statement."
What’s amazing about this is that I did not name any country in this tweet. I simply stated that genocide is wrong— ALWAYS. This is not a controversial stance. Interesting how you interpreted it.
"Meet Briana. Briana is just 22 years old, and chose to have bottom surgery years earlier after Jazz Jennings’ show and tik tok surgeons covinced him he’d be happier living as a woman. This is the most devastating interview I have ever given in my career and it is my hope that no matter where you stand on this issue, you take the time to watch this gut-wrenching interview which will drop tomorrow on my YouTube channel. "
"Always on point. Smear merchants are going out of business. Prove what you say is true, or shut up."
"MASSIVE STORY A judge has just overturned a mayoral primary election in Bridgeport, CT after Democrat operatives were CAUGHT BALLOT STUFFING. This video was leaked and reveals a Democrat clerk stuffing this drop box multiple times with illegal ballots in the same day. Judge Clark wrote in his ruling: “The volume of ballots so mishandled is such that it calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt and leaves the court unable to determine the legitimate result of the primary.” How common is this? Will this case be the first of many? Does this create legal precedent for future ballot stuffing cases?"
"No I did not hear it, but I don’t doubt it exists or that it was indeed horrific— I have seen despicable, inhumane things on the internet from either sides of this conflict. But the shameful conduct of some should never be used to justify the dehumanization of an entire group. To suggest that there are no innocent civilians (Israeli, Palestinian or otherwise) is genocidal rhetoric. It signals that it would be fine to kill every infant and child of a particular race because they are nothing but eventual terrorists. It is maniacal and wrong. There are always innocent civilians in every war. Brian Mast is not some college campus kid or a teenager on tik-tok. He is a sitting U.S congressman and his words carry weight."
"Yeah this was disgusting. Utterly dehumanizing. Of course there are innocent civilians on either side of every conflict and we should not forget that. This is shameful, inhumane rhetoric."
Never trust politicians who say they can reduce inflation by spending your money they can prevent extreme weather events by limiting what you eat they can stop a virus they created by forcing you to take pharmaceuticals they can improve life by varying clocks twice a year…
Don’t defend evil. It won’t age well.
"“When people are presented with the alternatives of hating themselves for their failures or hating others for their success, they seldom choose to hate themselves..” -Thomas Sowell"
"A Ukrainian official just told Time Magazine that 18 months into the war, corruption is as bad as ever. “People are stealing like there’s no tomorrow,"" and nobody fears accountability at all. Why are we paying for all this? "
The word “cis” is a heterosexual slur. Shame on anyone who uses it.
Tomorrow I sit down with the sex worker who believes she saves people’s marriages by sleeping with their spouses. Credit due to the New York Post for putting this therapist on my radar. And thank you to the podcast for introducing me to her. 
I have many gay fans. They just want nothing to do with the clinical insanity that is transgenderism. Why on earth should they be made to defend a dude that’s built like Hulk Hogan but is wearing hoop earrings so thinks he’s a chick? The answer is they shouldn’t.

Im certain that building an identity around quitting a bad habit is a surreptitious way of building energy to do it again ten fold down the road. When you’re done with something you withdraw it’s power instantly. You close the chapter. You turn the page
Every day should be feel like an entire life. Should be cycling through the entire pantheon of emotions in a single day. No slumps. No one state for too long. All of it combined. The peaks the falls the climax the resolution the denouement

"These chicks who go on these enlightenment journies of self discovery like nature walks, trendy fruit smoothies, yoga, self help books always end up with the baddest boy possible at the end of it"
We’re in a completely different epoch now. As a man you gotta be elite in almost everything just to get the common decency and respect men of old received jus 30 years ago. Literally gotta have all bases covered. Average and good is the equivalent to being invisible
All the gym & health advice round here is all level 1 shit. Having an impressive physique and impressive strength numbers should be the least interesting thing about you.
If a chick ever says you look like someone she 100% wants to fuck
This style of self immolation is a common arc among those who’ve had it all Plays on the human desire to go back to source. Why all the greats end up renouncing materialism & the flesh Man is born naked screaming n unsustained & it’s where he feels most at home

"Imagine getting hella rich so you can put your life in another man’s hands Kobes pilot, princess Di driver Controlling every aspect of your destiny is what got u rich in the 1st place Now you ride shotgun & let ppl carry ur bags LOL Forgot where u came from"
"It’s cuz modern women think what works for us also works for them It’s why they curse, want to be seen as strong n independent But we’re they’re reason for living and they’re not ours. They can’t fathom our business or football game can possibly be more important than them"

Heavy strength training corrects your aura. It’ll give you the thousand yard stare & fry your CNS to the point you no longer have a wandering mind. Can pinpoint focus on a monolithic objective once you have that. men operate at a higher level when they’re tired as fuck
How u can be out of shape And broke is beyond me. The 2 paired together are the death knell If you have low $ aspirations at least show you’ve done something wise with ur time?
Making mistakes intentionally is trying to bypass feeling the pain of a real mistake where you actually tried at something and failed
"You know who you really are by the good habits you keep when you’re dispirited Most people immediately stop training hard, eating well, taking care of their health the second life discourages them in any way Were never in it for the right reasons to begin with"

Hardest thing in life by far is keeping momentum after you get big kills. Body is hardwired to demand stasis and you need to exploit the fuck out of your manic phases to keep throttling. Gotta be a real sicko to win in this life
"The only homeopathic remedy that works is chainsmoking. Chicken noodle soup don’t work, tigerbalm don’t work, neosporin don’t work, herbal teas don’t work, but you can chainsmoke your way damn past anything"

Life starts when you’re more aware of why people do what they do than they are Not even fun till you get to this point
The reason people never try in general is very simple. They’re afraid of their life turning into a tragicomedy where everyone is in on the joke that they’re never gonna make it despise their best efforts. People don’t recover from just a sliver of that kinda embarrassment
"There’s a brand of masochism where guys will take attempts at things they know they have 0% chance of achieving Get rejected on purpose, lose on purpose cause there’s safety in guaranteed failure Actual courage is becoming the kinda person who could actually achieve it"
U hate cocky men Bc they aren’t easily manipulated into ur world view They laugh when u want them to cry They make the free throw when u want them to miss They’re not cold when you’re freezing U adore them Bc you can’t control them Male hatred is identical to female love

Opting out of the game ?
Basically misfortune is a way to leverage ur winning traits that stay dormant when shits going smooth
Very dumb to take any misfortune that comes your way at face value 9 times out of 10 it forces you to behave in ways you wouldn’t have before & you end up salvaging & getting a better outcome than you would have had before
Fiction far superior to non fiction More realistic too ironically. Gotta have a wide array of personal experience to infuse a fictional character with esprit & éclat More breadth in fiction
"You can’t create the right mindset for you by conceptualizing, reading, consuming content or thinking You start the journey headlong, descend into madness & winning auto fixes your mindset along the way"
"This is the fundamental of being a fucking man It’s Never your last chance. Not your last bitch, not your last business opportunity Ur never out of the game if ur a man Everytime you thought ur life was over it X Condition didn’t work out you were wrong"

"BREAKING NEWS: Second Circuit Court of Appeals grants bond pending appeal in the Douglass Mackey meme case The Second Circuit Court of Appeals just overruled the District Court in granting our motion for bond pending appeal. This ruling is huge because it means that the appeals court decided that my appeal presents ""substantial"" and ""debatable"" issues of law that, if resolved in my favor, will result in my conviction being vacated. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that my appeal was frivolous and that this was a typical election crime case like any other in U.S. history. This is a very encouraging step towards vindication. Here is the full text of the court order: Case Name: United States of America v. Mackey Case Number: 23-7577 Docket Text: MOTION ORDER, granting motion for release pending appeal, at docket entry 16 Mackey’s surrender date is stayed. The District Court is ordered to determine the appropriate terms of release, without prejudice to the government’s making a future request for detention, on behalf of Appellant Douglass Mackey, It is further ordered that this appeal is expedited. Mackey’s initial brief will be due on or before January 5, 2024. The government’s response will be due on or before February 5, 2024. Mackey’s reply brief will be due on or before February 20, 2024. The Clerk is directed to calendar this appeal as soon as practicable after February 20, 2024, GEL, MHP, OAW*, *Judge Omar A. Williams, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation, FILED. If we lose the appeal in the Second Circuit, we will swiftly file an appeal with the Supreme Court. I want to extend my gratitude and thanks to all benefactors, supporters, and all of the great attorneys who have worked on my case. It is not cheap, however, to appeal a case in the federal court system, so I am asking you to please help us fund this case in any way you can. Prayers are also welcome and appreciated, and I will, of course, keep all benefactors and supporters in my prayers. If you wish to support my cause financially, you may donate via the Meme Defense Fund (memedefensefund.com), a third-party nonprofit that has generously lent its support to this case. You also have the option of donating via GiveSendGo (). Or, you can send Bitcoin or other crypto, cash, or a check in the mail. More details on that are here: "

"🚨NEWS: Trump attorney Alina Habba is accused of tricking a Trump employee into signing a non disclosure agreement after alleged sexual harassment claims. A former Trump National Golf Club employee, Alice Bianco, has filed a lawsuit in a New Jersey court, accusing club manager Pavel Melichar of sexual harassment and coercion into sex in 2021. Bianco alleges retaliation in the workplace and an attempt to silence her through an illegal non-disclosure agreement (NDA) orchestrated by attorney Alina Habba. Following harassment, an anonymous co-worker informed Donald Trump's staff, prompting a human resources call to Bianco. Opting for legal representation, she claims that Habba, a club member and not yet a Trump lawyer, posed as a friend, forwarding a negative article about her lawyer, attempting to influence her to dismiss him. Habba allegedly met Bianco during a shift, dissuading her from going public and promising protection in exchange for signing an NDA. The agreement included a hefty penalty for violation, coupled with a purportedly paltry sum. Bianco's attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, asserted that Habba's actions were predatory, saying in a statement ""Pretending to be ‘neutral’ when acting on behalf of one party is clearly unethical."" These unethical allegations against Habba are unsurprising, despite her vehement denials, and consistent with the kind of people Trump consistently employs, certainly not ""the best people."

"The fact that canceled Mehdi Hasan's show while the absolutely horrible Andrea Mitchell is still employed there is proof that they are not listening to their audience. You may disagree with some of Medhi Hasan's positions, but you cannot disagree that he always came prepared for an interview. He was actually doing the thing that we believe journalists are supposed to be able to do: ask questions, and push through the bullshit when the person tries to avoid answering truthfully. Hasan is a hard-hitting journalist who consistently maintained a professional demeanor while insisting his guests answer his damn questions, no matter how uncomfortable they were. While MSNBC still retains some journalists whose work I still trust and admire, this decision stinks of politics, and I'm disgusted by it. Sorry to see him go."
"Lawrence O'Donnell just recapped how easily trump got away with the lie that he had people in Hawaii looking into President Obama’s birth certificate: ""he quickly learned how weak tv news could be in real-time fact checking, and he relies on that weakness to this day."" I remember screaming at the TV, asking ""where is the pushback, he's told these lies before, why aren't you prepared for this??"" whenever he repeated easily disproven lies. It was infuriating, they treated him like he was an oddity, like a side show instead of a dangerous carnival barker selling poison, and they never treated him like the threat he was. We don't have trump derangement syndrome. We just don't want that lying fucker pissing on us and saying that it's raining. We don't want him destroying our democracy. He once said if he lost to Joe Biden, he'd leave the country, and his stupid criminal ass is still here, running for President to try to stay out of prison. He should have just fucked off and painted, or played golf, or whatever it is that former Presidents do to stay the fuck out of our faces. Instead, he's facing 91 felony counts, and I will party my ass off when he's finally convicted. Until then, we're going to call out the news media when they go soft on trump, because they already failed us once before. And we're going to call out whatever bullshit Orange Jesus is selling. Believe me."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: In another disgusting and predictable trump attack today, Donald Trump took aim at Judge Arthur Engoron's family shortly after an appeals court reinstated a gag order against him. A New York appellate court implemented an unexplained gag order, restricting Trump from targeting court staff. Notably, this order excludes the judge and his family. Trump had previously directed attacks at the judge's wife, alleging she posted derogatory comments about him on social media. Undeterred by the limited order, the former president reiterated his accusations on Truth Social, stating, ""This is the Judge's Wife and Family that are putting these things out."" Trump questioned the fairness of the trial, emphasizing, ""Can this be happening in America? This is the most unfair Trial in the History of New York, and I've had some pretty unfair Trials!"" Accompanying his statement, Trump shared a tweet he attributed to the judge's wife, featuring images of him in an orange prison jumpsuit. The broader scope of the term ""family"" in Trump's reference remains unclear. Despite Trump's claims, Dawn Engoron has vehemently denied any association with a Twitter or X account, raising questions about the source and authenticity of the alleged disparaging remarks. Of course, most allegations coming from Trump have proven to be blatant lies that news media struggles to keep up with because he sprays the news cycle with so much falsehood. His dangerous attacks continue unabated, despite fines and gag orders. Judges will need to consider harsher penalties and consequences for Trump."
"BREAKING: trump's gag order preventing him from attacking Judge Engoron's clerk in his fraud trial has just been reinstated by a NY Appeals court. Imagine having to be forced NOT to threaten someone, and then imagine being a former President having to be forced NOT to threaten someone. He is a daily disgrace."
"No matter how ""moderate"" Nikki Haley tries to sound, remember that she's got Koch money behind her now because she's vowed to take away our Social Security. 🚨Make sure everyone sees this."
According to GOP MATH: 3 million jobs lost by trump is greater than 14 million jobs gained by Biden Trump's 91 felony counts are greater than Biden's 50 years public service Trump's less than 3% GDP is greater than Biden's 5.2% GDP. That math will NEVER add up.
"Good morning and Happy Thursday to everyone who knows that if Republicans had any evidence to impeach President Biden for anything, they’d have it plastered all over Fox News by now. Even MAGA Mike Johnson said there’s insufficient evidence to impeach our President."

Do you have the numbers? SS official: “We have systems in place to schedule, assign and track workloads…Real time understanding of what actions are being processed at any given time. Additionally, our employees are required to be accessible to their supervisors, clients, colleagues and external parties during work hours via a variety of different means” Boebert: “Then why has the backlog for social security backlogs increased?” SS official: “Because we’ve been historically underfunded.”"

"🚨🚨LORDY, THERE ARE TAPES: Recently-revealed audio receipts DESTROY Trump's attempted fraud defense. In a bombshell revelation during his civil fraud trial, Donald Trump attempted to shift blame for inflating his Trump Tower penthouse's value. However, a jaw-dropping audio recording from 2015 obtained by Forbes exposes Trump reciting the exaggerated square footage figures during an interview, contradicting his trial claims. Trump boasted, ""This wraps all around the building. And I have three times three. So there’s like 11,000 feet on a floor. So I have three. So 33,000—and I have the roof."" Yet, the actual square footage was just under 11,000. This revelation undermines Trump's attempt to distance himself and pin the blame on others within the Trump Organization. Forbes, which uncovered the square-footage discrepancy in 2017, notes that Trump falsely claimed at the trial to have personally spotted the error and directed corrections. The timeline reveals the truth—Forbes informed Trump's team in February 2017, but the incorrect figures persisted until after Forbes exposed the deception with an article titled 'Donald Trump Has Been Lying About The Size Of His Penthouse' in May 2017. This audio bombshell not only exposes Trump's false claims but raises questions about his credibility in the ongoing trial as the revelation suggests a calculated effort to inflate his assets."

Upon learning that Apple, the backers of the film, allowed his remarks to be removed, DeNiro bristled at the notion of thanking them. ""I don't feel like thanking them at all for what they did. How dare they do that, actually,"" DeNiro said. DeNiro had been discussing his latest project with director Martin Scorsese, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" when he discovered that his own remarks critical of Trump were removed from the teleprompter. So he read them from his phone. ""History isn't history anymore. Truth is not truth. Even facts are being replaced by alternative facts and driven by conspiracy theories and ugliness. In Florida, young students are taught that slaves developed skills which can be applied for their personal benefit."" ""Lying has become just another tool in the charlatan's arsenal. The former president lied to us more than 30,000 times during his four years in office, and he's keeping up the pace in his current campaign of retribution. But with all his lies, he can't hide his soul. He attacks the weak, destroys the gifts of nature, and shows disrespect — for example, by using 'Pocahontas' as a slur."" BRAVO to Robert DeNiro for always speaking the unvarnished truth to fans and critic alike."

Senator Tommy Tuberville deserves to lose his Senate seat for his disgraceful disrespect and systematic sabotage of our military. He is doing the bidding of America's adversaries.
We need to see a lot more of this in 2024.
"It must really bug trump that President Biden and President Obama are so widely respected and admired by many, and they're pals. Two of the BEST."
"Meet Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey. He’s working overtime to silence Missourians and undermine the democratic process to ensure abortion stays banned. Why? He knows if the people get a chance to vote, they’ll enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. He held up signature gathering-efforts for the amendment, pressured the state auditor to lie about the cost of the amendment, and had forced by the state Supreme Court to allow the measure to move forward. He’s already threatened to refuse to enforce the law if an amendment passed. To top it all off, he just went on local radio and claimed that satanists are suing the state to overturn its abortion ban. Of course that‘s a lie."
"Republicans like to focus on fake outrage issues like gas stoves and wokeness, but have zero solutions on real issues like corporate price gouging, the wage gap, and gun violence because they're too busy fighting each other. The GOP is broken and incapable of leading America."
"45 years ago, in a moment of horror and heartbreak, Dianne Feinstein announced that San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated. We mourn these two beacons of hope whose transformational legacies continue to inspire our quest for LGBTQ+ equality, and freedom from gun violence. -NP "
"Before Obamacare, millions of Americans didn't have coverage. Even more were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. And trump still wants to reverse that, without anything to replace it. We need to keep him FAR away from the Oval Office. Can I get a HELL YES? 🙏"
"If you prefer Presidents who care more about all Americans having access to healthcare than giving tax cuts to the rich, then I suggest you follow us at where we recognize that the Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but it has saved countless lives."
*IF* they expel his ass.
"The GOP absolutely deserves George Santos, and every bit of chaos he creates when they expel his ass."
"🚨SANTOS WILL EXPOSE ALL: Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) declared his refusal to resign from Congress, predicting his imminent expulsion while defiantly vowing to EXPOSE follow lawmakers' unscrupulous activities on his way out the door. Santos stated, ""I've done the math over and over, and it doesn't look really good"" for him as he faces the looming expulsion resolution. The Ethics Committee's damning 56-page report exposed a ""complex web of unlawful activity"" involving Santos' campaign, personal, and business finances. Unfazed, Santos vehemently vowed to defend himself ""to the end of time,"" dismissing the committee's investigation as biased. He brazenly called Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest (R-Miss.) a ""p***y,"" challenging him to stop stalling and push for a decisive vote on the expulsion resolution. Santos escalated the confrontation, labeling Congress as ""felons galore"" and lambasting colleagues as ""hypocrites."" He levied accusations of extramarital affairs, claiming colleagues indulged in excessive drinking with lobbyists, missed votes due to hangovers, and distributed voting cards like ""candy"" to permit others to vote on their behalf. This situation begs the question: with all of the easily-disproved lies Santos has been caught telling, and his shattered reputation and lack of credibility, even if he exposes his Congressional colleagues, who will believe him?"
"PRO TIP: If you're trying to prove you have all your marbles, maybe stop bragging that you ""ACED"" a test that asks you to identify animals and draw a clock. Also: This is HILARIOUS! 🤣🤣🤣"
"Abigail Edan, 4-year old hostage just released, who lost BOTH of her parents in the Hamas terrorist attack, an ordeal no child should ever have to endure. Reunited with family members. 🙏🥹"
Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who is appalled by the shooting of three Palestinian students who were shot in Vermont yesterday. I expect to see a full-throated condemnation of this shooting and of Islamophobia by our elected officials. HATE CANNOT WIN.

"I'm old enough to remember when trump threatened to remove Obamacare and replace it with ""something terrific."" He didn't remove it. He didn't replace it. He STILL wants to, despite the fact that millions are covered by it. I would NEVER vote for that cruel jackass."
Refusing to vote for Biden doesn't punish Biden. It punishes the people.
A vote for anybody other than Joe Biden is a vote for Trump. Yeah…it’s that simple.
"REMINDER: The Democratic party is responsible for creating Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment benefits, the Affordable Care Act, Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights, and so much more. Republicans are responsible for creating trump, January 6th, and George Santos."
"Simply awful. The demonization and dehumanization must stop. People need to start communicating with nuance and empathy. Our words have power and much of what we’re saying is leading to more hate, not less pain."
"Speaking as one of the 3.45 million Muslim Americans living here, I can confirm the insurrection inciter is lying as usual. Islam does not hate us, as in America or the West or whatever, not any more than any other religion would. And this is more proof that anyone who is voting for trump is voting for the kind of rhetoric that would turn an entire bigoted slice of his base against a group of people based on the religion they practice. I'll admit that President Biden isn't perfect, but he's head and shoulders better than the twice-impeached hate monger who is only running for President to avoid prison. I'll take four more years of President Biden over another nano second of the shit stain that is Donald trump."
"Despite the non-stop obstruction and chaos from Republicans, President Biden is STILL the most legislatively successful President in the modern era. And we can get even more done with a bigger Senate majority and retaking the House. Let's do it."
"If you're interested in keeping the progress moving forward with more Democratic policies, I suggest you follow us at where we are keeping score on who's moving the ball forward for America (Democrats) and who's fumbling it away (Republicans)."
"Good morning and Happy Sunday to everyone who agrees that not voting, or voting for anyone other than President Biden, will guarantee trump winning in 2024. Folks who will lose their rights or get rounded up in a trump presidency don't have the luxury of letting trump win."
"Hahaha, this billboard went up today in Columbia, South Carolina ahead of trump's visit to the Palmetto Bowl. Well played, South Carolina! 👏👏"
"Lmao, conservative heads exploding because Senator Mitt Romney said he'd vote for President Biden if Donald trump is the nominee. Well said, Senator. That is the CORRECT answer if you give a damn about America."
"Good morning and Happy Saturday to everyone who agrees that the Abraham Accords did NOTHING to bring peace to the Middle East, since it was just between countries not at war with each other. All it did was bring billions to the pockets of trump and Jared Kushner."
Live your life in such a way that people don't celebrate “Happy Shanksgiving” when you get stabbed in federal prison after being convicted for kneeling on an unarmed suspect to death.
"OMG, we just finished watching the last episode of a limited series on Netflix called All the Light We Cannot See, and it was INCREDIBLE.

When was the last time you saw so many former staff members of a former President speak so badly about the character of the President they served? Believe them.

"President Biden is STILL doing the polar bear plunge at his age, rides a bike, manages multiple international crises, gets bipartisan legislation passed, and creates more jobs than any of his predecessors. He's still got it. And he's got MY vote."
"What the hell happened to me, I used to HATE leftovers when I was younger, but the Thanksgiving leftovers in my fridge today got me like"
"I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you, Jen."
"In the Americas, Jen. Which is why they are referred to as Native Americans."
Why is this so difficult for so many people to understand. Ukraine is corrupt.
"And everybody knows this so why do we keep wasting time? Everyone also knows what it means when we say we’re on a mission to “spread democracy”, like we did in Afghanistan or “fight for democracy” like we’re doing in Ukraine. Zelensky is a corrupt dictator. Stop pretending we are there defending democratic principles. Masks are dropping everywhere. I just don’t understand who our politicians are lying to and for anymore."
"I think you misunderstood my tweet. The UN was created (in large part) due to the United States pushing this false idea that international liberalism could work. It can’t. The UN has always been a joke and the US has always known that, hence the reason we ourselves openly decide when to adhere to or ignore their policies. America has been in decline since we took on policing the world following world war 2. International liberalism has failed. It’s time to stop this performative overseas concept and return to national sovereignty."
"I still do not support sending a single American son, daughter, or dollar overseas to aid in a foreign war. And I’m getting really exhausted with people using emotional arguments to try to explain why it’s our perpetual duty to put Americans last."
"International liberalism following World War 2 has been an abject failure. If America doesn’t have to follow the rules or respect UN votes than the mask has dropped and countries will resort back to national sovereignty and the laws of the jungle. As says, might will be right."
"If you’d like to read further into Native American cannibalism, I invite you to read Rodney Stark’s “How the West Was Won”. Excellent book. If you prefer your trusted left-leaning sources, PBS and New York Times has written upon the matters and even the most cursory of google searches will pull up these facts. Again, I’m sorry life isn’t a Disney movie and Native Americans weren’t marching with Pride Flags."
"While shocking and vile, the well documented truth regarding native American cannibalism is not racist. What is racist is the perpetuated lie about Europeans committing genocide against them when in fact 90% were killed by the epidemic of small pox. Yes, the Europeans carried over the disease unwittingly but the resulting deaths of the natives, while sad, was not intentional. What is similarly shocking and vile is that you are trying to rewrite tribal, Native American history to include this bizarre and perverted American chapter of trying to brainwash children to chop their genitals off."
"Yes, native Americans also did drugs and if all of this upsetting to you, you really should skip over the chapter regarding the Aztecs and child sacrifice. They weren’t trannies, but they were tribal and slaughtered en masse to honor temples."
"The Native Americans were not trannies. LOL. I cannot even believe students are learning this on university campuses. Also, yes, Native Americans did cannibalize one another. I’m sorry Pocahontas the Disney animated movie wasn’t real. "

"I know I need to stop fan-girling Thomas Sowell so hard (yes, I’d probably cry if I met him) but I’ve just tucked into this one and it’s already so interesting."
"Men of today are not men of yesteryear. Bodes well for my boys to be alpha males as they grow. Of course, I set the example for them."
Most weak men just talk.. that’s all they can do. Doing is always the hardest part
"I’m not playing the victim. I actually AM 9 months pregnant and you actually ARE a very small man who thinks Tweeting is a career. Every man and woman that you take shots at (literally all day) has accomplished more than you have in the real world. But you call them all grifters because you’re an envious brat, not an intellectual. Go lead your family or build something that would make them proud. I promise you, it’s not going to be a substack."
"Any man who opens his smartphone to launch an all-day cat fight with a woman on Twitter is a little bitch. There is not one exception to this rule, left or right. These men should be mocked and ridiculed by other men with higher levels of testosterone."

This is your great comeback? That I promoted a product that I actually believed in that wound up not working out in the long run? This is the comeback to your consistent hatred of Jews and black people until you became a Desantis influencer? You’re a dweeb—an example of why the west should stop casually talking ourselves into foreign wars. We no longer produce the sort of men to fight in them.
I agree on your point about female emotionality but would like to clarify that I don’t believe everyone can change. I just think we should wait until they are out of college and in the real world to determine who they are.
Like this dude doesn’t even have the right to criticize AOC & Ilhan Omar. And he really came for me today over my use of the word “interesting”.
"I’m sharing this article so that people understand that you are the worst kind of grifter. You really want people to believe that you went from a racist, antisemite to some great political philosopher overnight? You really woke up with some audacity today to try to paint me as some pro-Hamas antisemite. Unlike you, in my private texts messages, I don’t speak negatively about black people and Jews. In short, you’re a little bitch of a man who tweets from a glass house and routinely throws stones. Love, “the negress”."
"Simplifying complex issues into 'with us or against us' terms undermines meaningful dialogue. We can advocate for justice, public health, and global security without making sweeping generalizations about those who disagree."
My position: “Everyone who disagrees with me wants black men killed by police” (BLM) “Everyone who disagrees with me wants Grandma dead” (Covid) “Everyone who disagrees with me is on Putin’s payroll” (Ukraine) “Everyone who disagrees with me wants genocide” <—- we are here.
"To be clear, I have many friends that are pro-Israel and friends that are pro-Palestine. I refuse to pretend that any of them are pro-genocide simply because the mob on either side demands it. Grow up. All of you."
Or is this your way of trying to prove yourself to the Jewish people you hated that you really are different now? By pretending that me saying “interesting” is problematic. You are pathetic and nobody is buying this rebrand. 
"Pedro wants you to believe that college students can’t change, but he just did: Literally, if ever there was a political fraud, Pedro is it."
Pedro I want to be very clear that after you privately called me a “negress” and privately referred to most Jews at problematic (among other things)— that you will not be the person that calls balls and strikes on antisemitism. You’re lucky I didn’t pile on when you were going through it but you are out of your entire mind if you think I’m going to allow you interpret the word “interesting” as pro-Hamas. Just shut up. 
I appreciate Elon’s sense of humor but mostly how little he cares when everyone screams at him.
"The Middle East looks like a murder-suicide situation. The only wrinkle is people don’t agree who is the murderer and who is the suicide. It’s obviously not fixable. In the long run, the entire region is unlikely to be habitable. If you disagree, describe any other possible outcome without sounding under-informed."
"Breaking: Chants of “allahu akbar” (Allah is greater) break out near the Winston Churchill statue and Big Ben at the London Palestine protest. The large crowd, which feature some speaking officials, is demanding Israel cease its war with Hamas."
Israel just announced that it’s pulling its diplomats out of Turkey in light of Erdogan’s escalating rhetoric. Many of us who expressed concern about this potential for escalation were dismissed.
"Erdogan has just expressly called out the West at this rally. “O West, I’m calling out to you. Do you want to start a Crescent-Crusader clash again?”"

"Never ask a man his salary, a woman her weight, or the legal advisor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff the lawful basis by which US forces are stationed in Syria."
It took awhile and I had to endure a lot of smears but the world finally realized I was telling the truth. What happened to Derek Chauvin is a tragedy.
"I give grace to anyone who freaked out about COVID when it first happened, there was little knowledge and it was scary. I give no grace to anyone who demanded harsher lockdowns by Sept. 2020.

For those who are upset that I am sharing/discussing this— 1) This is a sizable protest in a place that I consider a second home. My children are British and we are headed to London today. 2) I’ll share and discuss what I want.
Some people believe this. That the protests across Europe are more of a reflection of the migrant crisis.
Some people believe this. That it’s just “the current thing” so to speak.
What’s going on here?
Interesting thing happening here. People are not accepting the media narrative about what is happening in the Middle East despite the insistent rhetoric from government officials.

It feels like anything can happen to Christians and nobody cares. Certainly not our government.
Mass shootings every weekend in Philadelphia Baltimore Chicago St Louis. You can find who has illegal guns by watching their social media. FBI and ATF don’t care. They let it happen. They want YOUR guns. It’s obvious why. Stop falling for this stuff.
Freedom can be messy - but the liberty of free speech in a political context must be upheld. Must. Be. Upheld. We have survived decades of the progressives saying evil things about America and conservatives. We do not win by shutting them down in the same manner.
I will never accept the infringement of American rights. We need people in office who understand that and do not give in to smear merchant campaigns.
"College campus students literally burned Michael Knowles in effigy this year, set fire and smashed windows when Milo went to Berkeley, and recently chased Riley Gaines through hallways. They have been espousing anti-white, anti-American and anti-police, terrorist rhetoric for years. Pulling down statues of white men like Robert E. Lee. “Only good cop is a dead cop” and “no justice no peace” were favorited signs during George Floyd campus protests. Why no proposals for blacklists then? Why weren’t they hunting down and identifying High school protesters back then? I’m dying to know."
"Lastly, and as I have always said, if there is specifically any individual that is explicitly calling for the death or genocide of people on either side of this conflict— they should be identified and forced to deal with the consequences. But we know these people are on the fringes. Trying to find fringe samples of a minority to justify the silencing of a majority is not something I will ever stand for as an American. It is and will forever be spineless behavior."
"Gigi Hadid is allowed, as the daughter of a Palestinian, to be pro-Palestine. Gal Gadot is allowed, as an Israeli, to be pro-Israel. If you think one is allowed and not the other, it’s because you are engaging in tactics of dehumanization. I won’t stand for it. No one should."

Most are cowardly. There are a ton of text chains going on behind the scene of prominent conservatives who think what is happening is wrong but are afraid of being smeared.
And I want to be clear that I do not support it. It was wrong when the media and leftists smeared conservatives and MAGA rallies and its wrong now that the media and neo-cons are engaging in the same behavior.
The reality? They cannot win people over on the basis of their arguments so they are resorting to leftist tactics of becoming smear merchants. “Everyone supporting MAGA is a white supremacist! “Every person at a pro-Palestine protest is a Holocaust denier!” It’s cheap & gross.
High school now?! This is disgusting. Every person cheering this on is either a neo-con or has no fundamental understanding of why first amendment rights need to be protected.

Retweeting bc this provides important context regarding Florida’s move to shut down this student group.
This is sad but true. I’ve been saying for years that the ADL is single-handedly responsible for sentiments against Jewish Americans because they falsely labeled too many people and things antisemitic. Dennis Prager warned about this for years. Smear merchants do more harm than good.
It’s a very important academic debate to have now.
"If that’s your belief then go for it. But my instincts tell me that what I am seeing in terms of calls to ban speech, shut down student groups, and create black lists is going to have the opposite desired effect. Hope I’m wrong! And would welcome a friendly discussion publicly with anyone who believes this is the right way to deal with these students."
"This is obviously what is going to happen. It will backfire. It’s already backfiring. I’ve never seen less support for Israel in my life despite virtually everyone agreeing that the terrorist attack was horrific. No one is being honest that shutting down student groups, banning protests, etc will work only to further sentiments against Jewish people."
When universities were talking black lists for conservatives did it make you less conservative? Did it lessen support for Trump when they tried to get Trump supporters fired from their jobs? Save these tweets because my sentiment is going to be proven correct in the long run.
I’ll ask the obvious question here. Do people believe that in the future moves like this will increase or decrease feelings of anti-semitism? Do you think these students are going to shut down and think “well— guess we have to support Israel now”? This is a serious question.

Incubation period to reconnect w nature & reformat their brain. Then reward themselves by goin right back into the madness
Every dude who harps on strict 8 hours sleep & energy conservation never seems to do anything with all the energy they built up Staying refreshed is their mission. Running away from life at every turn
When your mission is salient enough your problems will be incomprehensible to anyone but you—This is when you know you’re on the path. the pep talks no longer mean a things. Finding solutions all that matters
Modern challenges are so trite & dull that you have to make life intentionally a lot more difficult on yourself if you want to build character. Challenges that seem pointless just to overcome them. Steadies you when you start gunning after your purpose
"Minimalism is incredibly effective when ur first starting out. Bare bones low tech approach to training, biz. Just you & the schematic. Comes to a point you realize almost all products and services are marketed to people who will never start anyway"
If u tell yourself you can’t pursue ur dreams cause ur afraid ur gonna die if it doesn’t work out you’re lying. Ground beef is $3 a lb & a blowup mattress is 50 bucks. You’re afraid of the person you’d have to be to succeed
Pacing is such a closers formation. U get lost in the moment. So easy to lock on target of what ur trying to say. No doubt dudes have closed their bigger deals pacing like a Siberian tiger back & forth. Other person on the other end of the line at a serious disadvantage

"A lot of the glitches ur seeing in ur life are stemming from havoc in ur gut. I’m sure of this. Bad dreams, clumsy behavior, common ankle sprains, skin dysfunction, irritability, misplacing ur car keys 3x a day. Crazy shit happening from perforations In the gut lining"
Something very anti human about people hellbent on over educating themselves. Trying to gut the risk out of everything. Safety. Certainty. Very robotic pathways. Turns them spiritually gay

"Certain aura when ur so engrossed in ur work u forget to shave for a week, been rocking the same hoodie 7 days in a row. Generally just unkempt with a stony gaze. People give you that silent nod when u stride into a room"
Discipline is honestly for slaves. Discipline enjoyers have to jump through constant mental hoops to get shit done Obsession slays discipline As hard as it is for the average person to get themselves in the gym. That’s how hard it is for me not to go
"Things like set schedules, structure, discipline are porn for normies. Obsession is the highest calling. Can take a hundred detours & decide everything on the fly & you’re still gonna get there"
Basically all extraordinary men I’ve ever met flip emotions on their head Laugh when they’re supposed to cry Calm when they should be enraged Enraged when they should be calm Little shit bugs them but the big shit doesn’t at all Warped relationship with pain & welcome it
"When your back is against the wall it's not your family, friends, girlfriends, nation, investment portfolio that will save you, it will just be you and your mind. Invest in what matters first, your mission is all you have"
You turn yourself into something other people can respect and coincidences really do the rest of the work At that point you can just go roam the world & opportunities come in droves just bein urself. Respect means u can stop forcing shit
Life very simple as a man. Leave every interaction with someone either torn to pieces laughing or wondering who the fuck is this guy. Doors start prying open
Remember capitalism is where all the real competition is. It’s too sophisticated n complex for most. Broke people inspire fights with higher status folks cause they’re frustrated they can’t play the game. So they want u to play primitive games instead

If you think poor people are broke cuz they’re lazy you’re wrong. Nothing lazy about working 12 hour days in the retail pit Being poor is a mental illness. It’s all about convincing yourself other people deserve better than you & then hating them for it

I’ll add that it’s poetic as fuck that vegetating is a pejorative term to denote laziness. Vegetables have zero power. Another L for the vegans
If ur low on the totem pole you should never be vegetating in front of the tv or computer. It quells all your anger. Gotta learn to sit there staring at blank walls in ur own dissatisfaction. U’ll start to get very pissed off at ur situation & leave no choice but to make moves

Exclusive! Trump Announces Plans To Stop The Theft Of The 2018 Midterm Elections 
"🚨NEWS: Federal prosecutors are working to secure a hefty sentence for a January 6th attacker who bragged about his assault on a police officer, literally showcasing his hands covered in the cop's blood. ""I fed him to the people,"" he said. Jack Wade Whitton Jr. can be seen in photos and video assaulting officers, even beating some with a metal crutch and dragging an injured cop to the floor. During the melee, he can be heard yelling ""You're gonna die tonight!"" Prosecutors what Whitton Jr. slammed with a sentence of at least 97 months in prison and pay a fine of over $61,000. Perhaps most damning was the evidence he produced against himself, as his own Instagram post shows his bloody hands and reads “This is from a bad cop. Yea I fed him to the people. Idk his status. And don’t care tbh.” People like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who lament the treatment and prosecution of January 6th attackers, should be asked by reporters to defend or denounce the actions of specific people like Whitton Jr."
Joe Biden negotiated the release of hostages from Hamas Donald Trump negotiated the release of 5000 taliban soldiers.
"I remember watching the time go by as the violence continued, and wondering why he wouldn't make a statement to tell them to leave. Then we heard later that he told McCarthy “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” Unforgiveable."
"If you plan to refer to trump as insurrection inciter for the foreseeable future, then I suggest you follow us at where we believe what he did was unprecedented and unforgiveable, and we hope history books judge him as accurately and harshly as we do."
"May all the other hostages join them soon. May the ICRC be allowed immediate access to all remaining hostages. May humanitarian aid reach everyone in Gaza. May we find leaders who can lead us out of this perpetual wilderness. May this be the first step toward a different future for Palestinians, Israelis, and us all."
"Lyin' Ted: It has been over 24 hours since New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the Rainbow Bridge incident was not terror related, and Senator Ted Cruz still has this post up. Cruz wrote ""This confirms our worst fear: the explosion at Rainbow Bridge was a terrorist attack."" Even Community Notes from X has weighed in, and reiterated that it was an accident, not a terrorist attack. Is Ted Cruz just lazy, or is he lying?"
"BREAKING: The first group of hostages has been released into the custody of the Red Cross, as per NBC News."
"Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone who has been supportive of this account, sticking with me through good times and bad throughout these crazy years, I am truly thankful for you all and appreciate you. We are stronger together!🙏💪💙"
"I was pissed when a Colorado judge refused to take trump off of the ballot for insurrection. But then that SAME judge confirmed that trump “engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement,” so it's official: he is an insurrectionist. Be sure to call him that."

"Good morning and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone who is thankful to be alive, thankful for health and family, and thankful to live in an America under President Biden's experienced leadership. He doesn't just MAKE promises. He keeps them. Four more in 2024."
"Cowardly GOP candidate Nikki Haley refuses to answer a 15-year old's question of whether trump is a threat to democracy. She had the young man removed. If she can't even answer tough questions from teens about threats to democracy, she shouldn't lead."
"My teenage son and daughter are still awake now, but I ain't mad. They're not watching TV. They're not on their phones. They're playing backgammon. I feel blessed. "
Ted Cruz refuses to delete this long debunked notion that the Rainbow Bridge incident was a terrorist attack. What can we expect from the guy who let trump diss his wife and his father before bending the knee. Pathetic.
"The DNA of what was once President Lincoln's party has been inexorably changed by Trump for the worst. Unable to rebuke him, they can only hope their complicit silence hasn't completely destroyed their party. They traded honor and country, and all they got was a red hat."
"I know a lot of people who go to great pains to get the information right on critical issues. If you want to be a leader, that matters. Telling the truth matters. Kari Lake is straight up LYING. Kari Lake is nothing but a pathetic, losing, LIAR, and does not deserve to be Governor, Senator, or anything but UNEMPLOYED."

EVERYTHING WE SAID ABOUT J6 IS TRUE.

Sounds like a much better alternative to World War III
Wow the Trump administration was truly committed to creating PEACE in the Middle East. Compare this plan to the plan of the warhawks and neocons that simply just want death and destruction in the region. and a second Trump administration could get Gaza thriving. Peace and prosperity should be the only goal!
"FLASHBACK: The Trump Administration created the Israel-Palestine ‘Peace to Prosperity Plan,’ which would have secured Israel’s borders while also creating economic opportunities and better lives for the Palestinians without having American taxpayers borne the cost. and negotiated $50B in commitments from Middle Eastern nations and private investors to fund the plan. has offered to help rebuild Gaza after the Israel-Hamas war, I know the next Trump administration will gladly work with him."
Welcome home. Trump 2024!
Wow how pathetic 😂😂😂

Wow it’s being reported that is having his staff BLOCK anti-DeSantis accounts on his account. Sensitive!!!
"Instead of spending thanksgiving with his wife and kids (because he doesn’t have any), 55 year old drunken desantis influencer John Cardildo spent the holiday threatening random people in instagram DMs. Don’t turn out like John, kids!"

But I had to leave the mainland when Trump won.” Me: “that’s interesting, what didn’t you like about Trump?” Him: “he doesn’t want the rich to pay their fair share. Look at what the rich are doing to americas cities — like San Francisco! It used to be perfect but now the wealthy have ignored the poor in the city and it’s fallen apart. That’s the f****** country Trump wants.” Me: “you know San Francisco is completely run by democrats right?” Him: (takes off on a wave and doesn’t talk to me anymore) Moral of the story: people who refuse to use common sense are impossible to reason with — don’t even bother trying."
"I fought to lift President Trump's gag order and won. But the fight doesn't end here. We must work to re-elect Trump on November 5, 2024. Together, we can protect ALL Americans' First Amendment and due process rights."

All of the “influencers” that have been shilling for desantis on this platform for months are now posting endorsement graphics of him and the bottom of the graphics say “Paid for By DeSantis for President” 🤔🤔🤔
"Wishing you all a safe, blessed, and Happy Thanksgiving. Please let’s not forget the brave men & women in uniform, and our first responders, who are unable to be with their loved ones on this day. We thank them for keeping our communities and nation safe. God Bless 🇺🇸"

"When people take themselves too seriously — when they go out of their way to be offended by everything — they only create more animosity and division. They aren't preventing harm; they're preventing healing by refusing to let humor do its work. Everyone got along better back when they laughed, both at themselves and each other."

"In this video, provided to me by a relative on site, you can see the destruction at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza. The ancient sanctuary remains standing, but the church annex, which includes offices and meeting spaces for the Christian community, collapsed from an Israeli airstrike, killing multiple members of three connected Orthodox Christian families, who are my relatives. They are my dad’s first cousins and their spouses, children, and in-laws. May their memories be eternal."
"Respectfully, if you think it’s antisemitism to notice that innocent Christians were killed in an IDF bombing then you need to log off of the internet and have your brain examined. Respectfully."
"Also 120,000 Christian are being cleansed out of Armenia last month. Nobody said a word, never saw it in the news."
"I was really worried about this. 😔 With great sadness, I have now confirmed that several of my relatives (including Viola and Yara pictured here) were killed at Saint Porphyrius Orthodox Church in Gaza, where they had been sheltering, when part of the complex was destroyed as the result of an Israeli airstrike. Give rest, O Lord, to their souls, and may their memories be eternal. The Palestinian Christian community has endured so much. Our family is hurting badly. May God watch over all Christians in Gaza—and all Israelis and Palestinians who are suffering, whatever their religion or creed."
"My family and I would like to express our heartfelt appreciation for the many kind and gracious messages of condolence for our beloved cousins in Gaza. Please remember the thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians, in unbearable circumstances, who simply want a life of peace. So many of the people suffering are just children. They don’t deserve violence and death."
"Well said, Charlie. I have been disgusted by the propagandists pretending a Christian church was not bombed. Christians were killed. No Christian should stay silent."
".: ""Do you know how much money I would have made if I leaned into a liberal leftist..."" : ""You could be hosting the nightly news...It is not easy being a black conservative."" Watch Candace Owens on Bill Maher's podcast here: "
“The kids have never been sicker.” and Bill Maher agree that Big Pharma is taking advantage of parents by forcing kids to get vaccines that they do not need e.g. the COVID vaccine.
Watch documentary ‘The Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM (2022)’
"2 people who probably don't agree on much, talking for 90 minutes, is entertaining no matter what"
I’ll be honest: Bill Maher and I had way too much fun together. From him yelling at me about the moon landings to him cry-laughing by the end— we genuinely had a blast. 
Hatred of white males has been flourishing on college campuses for decades. Why didn’t you want to cut off funding for that?
 told us it was all lies. 
"Ah, yes, the ""Call of Duty"" school of international relations—because nothing says 'statesmanship' like treating geopolitics like a game of capture the flag. Maybe it's time we stopped electing people who think diplomacy is a series of quick time events. "
"This is how war works, right? We like, really really wanna win, so we will!"
If you’ve only experienced world wars through a textbook you find yourself wondering how on earth they come about. These past two weeks have made that clear: because virtually everyone in a position of power or influence is an emotionally reactive idiot with an inability to think long term. They think war is a video game or a high school football match and they just have to have school spirit to win.

The footage of the grandfathers in Ukraine being forced to fight in a war that is impossible for them to win is absolutely heartbreaking. As an American I feel awful that our government is funding their imminent deaths. We need Trump back in office ASAP so he can end that war and deliver peace so the death will end!

Vivek— you’re excellent here. Sorry you’re being slurred as “pro-Hamas” for refusing to engage in political theatre and keeping a clear mind about the very serious chain reaction that could be caused in the Middle East. Everyone should watch this. 
"Excellent. After weeks of theatrical, histrionic, ill-advised commentary, this arrives as a smack-down to neo-con warhawks. How? By simply speaking through the actual foreign policy objectives and long-term implications like adults rather than emotionally-visceral children."
You cannot slur people into seeing things your way.
Are we an example of a free Democracy? Who authorized Biden to pledge 100billion more of our tax dollars to Ukraine & Israel? America has become an oppressive regime to its own citizens. America should intervene in the increasing number of conflicts that are building here.
I don’t know who needs to hear this today but it does not make you antisemitic to want to stay out of an overseas conflict. Just like it did not make you a “russian puppet” to not want to send your hard earned dollars to Zelensky. Stop the nonsense.
"We are cattle now. Your open air prison may be nicer than another’s, and it’s better than the gulags, but we don’t have a country anymore. We are taxed to death for money launderers worldwide and within DC. Cattle. Mooooo!"
I have never once been burned by waiting for more information.
"If you are just repeating as fact the first bits of information you get from clearly biased sources out of a war zone then you are either incredibly stupid or incredibly dishonest, or both"
I’m an not a politician and i don’t wanna talk politics… i only answer to the people that made me and that’s my FANS aka THE PEOPLE… i love y’all with every bone in my body man Squaddd
Can you pull up some old tweets of the “old Candace” commenting on overseas conflicts that do not involve America? I’m desperate to meet that Candace.
I should add here that if you make the mistake of seeing any nuance— you will be instantly designated as a terrorist sympathizer or a genocide sympathizer. Better to commit entirely to one side and see absolutely no nuance or complication in these matters.
"Further to that point, there really is no point in engaging—people have their minds made up. Either the IDF is alway the hero and can make no mistakes, or the IDF are alway terrorists and can do nothing good/virtuous."
Interesting study into the fog of war and confirmation bias today on Twitter. The OFFICIAL truth (as shared by each individual invested in it) just so happens to be exactly what that individual had hoped. Not a single exception.
"It’s not hard to understand what’s going on here in DC. A vote for Jim Jordan is a vote to break Congress’s bad habit of passing a bloated omnibus spending bill every year. Jordan is a threat to the broken way of doing things, and that’s why he has my full support for Speaker."
They’ve already decided on war. Now it’s about propaganda to convince the public that American involvement is necessary and morally justified.
"It is easy to blame the students. It is harder to examine the ecosystem of persistent lies that has cemented their hatred— even for their own country. In order to fix it, the American colleges themselves must be made to suffer financially. I would again like to state how wonderful it is that donors are beginning to pull their funding. It is long overdue."
"Two years ago I enrolled in an online course at UCLA law. I kid you not when I say my final exam essay was to argue against Project Veritas by representing the arguments of the New York Times in their ongoing defamation case. For weekly extra credit in this class, we were encouraged to show proof of attending various social justice events. Imagine attending a protest for extra credit? I declined to attend these events but I am sharing this experience now to underscore just how severe indoctrination has become across college campuses. Professors will literally offer to improve your grade if you attend a protest or “get involved” in a variety of their left-leaning causes. In this same class, the assigned textbook stated that Donald Trump gassed protesters on his way to visit the church during BLM riots. It was a literal printed lie in a university textbook. I of course argued with my professor and the students who were convinced it did actually take place. People do not realize the state of college campuses today and how nearly impossible it is for students not to fall victim to the lies they are learning in their classrooms."
Lol. It was honestly kind of the highlight of my weekend. I never take that stuff seriously because it’s always as funny as it is absurd to report someone for disagreeing with you. More on that here:

I think it's reasonable to be relieved that the Rainbow Bridge incident was NOT a terrorist attack. Unless you watch Fox News. Watching Fox is unreasonable.
"I'm seeing a ton of right wing accounts on this platform have already rushed to declare the Rainbow Bridge explosion a ""terrorist attack"" without getting official confirmation from authorities. It might turn out that's what it was. I prefer to wait for the facts."
"Thanksgiving: Turkey, chicken, ham, or vegan?"
"How did they reboot the movie Nosferatu, and didn't think to cast Stephen Miller? Seems like a missed opportunity."
"A partial list of people who served in the trump Admin, and have spoken out against the twice-impeached, 91-felony count, deranged and disgraced former president trump: Mike Pence Bill Barr James Mattis Mark Esper Gen. Mark Milley Rex Tillerson Nikki Haley Chris Christie HR McMaster John Bolton Gen. John Kelly Mick Mulvaney Michael Cohen Stephanie Grisham Betsy DeVos Elaine Chao Richard Spencer Ty Cobb Cassidy Hutchinson, a trump aide who testified against him to the January 6th Committee and recently warned America about trump, endorsed President Biden instead: “Everybody should vote for him if they want democracy to survive.” Lastly, even trump spoke out against someone under indictment being the President, when in 2016 he said a president under indictment would “cripple the operations of our government” and create an “unprecedented constitutional crisis.” He suggested that Hillary Clinton merely being investigated, not even indicted, meant that she ""has no right to be running."
"BREAKING: Dem wins the Louisiana sheriff’s race by one vote. When people say that every vote counts, this is what they mean."
"If Hunter Biden's poll numbers keep dropping like this, Americans might have to consider not voting for him, and voting for his Dad instead."
"Good morning and Happy Wednesday to everyone who is glad we have a President who helps negotiate the release of hostages instead of a disgraced former guy who praises Hezbollah. Thanks, President Biden."
"Marked safe from not having to spend $114 on an overpriced, elite Thanksgiving turkey like this tool. Average nationwide prices are $25-$35."
Nothing refreshes my memory of what I need at the grocery store like coming home from the grocery store.
"Remember all those trumpers blaming President Biden for the lack of $2/gallon gas, despite the fact that he doesn't control the gas prices? Thanks Joe Biden!"
"Republicans lie about the price of turkeys, but here's the truth: Trump gave the ultra-rich a huge tax break, which cost taxpayers $8 trillion dollars. And they screamed whenever Biden tried to give the little guy a leg up. Remember, Republicans are the real turkeys in 2024."
MAJOR BREAKING: The Israeli Cabinet has just agreed to a deal for the release of up to 50 hostages and an increase in humanitarian aid to Palestinians in exchange for a 5-day pause in bombing and a Palestinian prisoner release.
"🚨This is INSANE: A day after his attorney argued to federal judges over his gag order, Trump proves with another outrageous Truth Social post why the judge should put him in jail. ""A Rigged Trial going on against me by a corrupt N.Y. State Attorney General and an out of control Judge,"" Trump raged in his Truth Social post. ""They brought Values down to a FRACTION of what they are really worth, like Mar-a-Lago, and then called me a Fraud. They are the FRAUDSTERS, and the whole system is CORRUPT. I didn’t even include one of my most valuable assets, BRAND VALUE, in my Financial Statements."" ""Also, this Psycho Judge refuses to acknowledge the fact that I have a 100% Disclaimer Clause on the First Page of my Statements - 'DUE YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE,'"" Trump's unhinged rant continued. ""But it all doesn’t matter, because regardless of what we say to show our TOTAL INNOCENCE, and it has been proven in many ways, and many times over, this political, Trump Hating Judge, together with his horrendous, seething with ANGER Law Clerk, with her illegal campaign contributions, will find me guilty as hell."" ""NO JURY ALLOWED, A STATUTE NEVER USED FOR THIS BEFORE, A RIGGED TRIAL, A RACIST & CORRUPT ATTORNEY GENERAL, A TRUMP HATING JUDGE, ELECTION INTERFERENCE!"" Trump spewed. If there are no consequences for this unhinged, volatile behavior, he'll just keep doing it."
"I'm really sick and tired of that racist loser former ""president"" calling Black District Attorneys and Black Attorneys General ""racist."" He keeps using that word. I don't think he knows what it means."
While they are worried about a parade they let him in right under their noses.
"Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate for President, is calling for a national abortion ban. 🚨Make sure EVERYONE sees this. 🚨"
I prefer 81 birthdays over 91 felony counts. Reason I will vote for Biden.
People are telling me went after me on her show today. Here is my final response to her: 
"If is anti-Semitic then everyone is anti-Semitic and the term has no meaning. It is an absurd, baseless attack. A classic leftist tactic of simply labeling someone rather than engaging with their arguments."
Announcing Bentkey's first live-action feature film: Snow White and the Evil Queen starring 
Couldn’t be more excited that the secret is finally out. Greatest thing happening—Everyone please share and support. Bentkey has officially been launched by the Daily Wire! Without question what my children will be watching. Disney is dead.
"The new American way: -Indoctrinate children for 18 years, K-12. -Peer pressure them to go to college to ensure they acquire hundreds of thousands of debt in the process, by telling them they will be failures otherwise. -Indoctrinate them further as young adults -Place them on blacklists for having the wrong ideas (the ones that were systematically taught to them over the course of two decades) so that when they graduate college, no employer will hire them. Too bad and good luck, students!"
How many American politicians have put out a statement this week saying that their top priority amid the chaos overseas is to assure the safety and security of the United States? How many presidential candidates? Few if any. We should all understand how absolutely insane that is
Quick update. Yesterday it meant “wanting children to die overseas”. At least that’s what I jotted down.
"Megyn, you seem to be taking this personally. I am not attacking you, I am attacking your position that students should be put on blacklists or that the majority of them are genuinely marching to celebrate the death of grandmas overseas. I just don’t think you honestly believe that— perhaps I am wrong. If you watched my show, you would know that I routinely feature your commentary and refer to it as brilliant. I just patently and vehemently disagree with your take here which I should be allowed to express, free from you tagging my place of employment."
"This is legitimately comical. LMAO. If you want to measure just how disingenuous neo-cons are being in their effort to demand war, look no further than Charlie Kirk being labeled an antisemite. Charlie has endured YEARS of being confronted on college campuses from protesters accusing him of being a “Zionist shill”. He is known to be radically pro-Israel and minted countless pro-Israel initiatives across college campuses. There are hours upon hours of footage available on the internet or Charlie Kirk defending Israel— even from within its borders. If Charlie Kirk is an anti-Semite than the categorization carries no real meaning and accusations of it will unfortunately illicit no response in the future."
Yes I do remember. Sorry I couldn’t actually make your show in the end. I’m not sure what obscure point you’re trying to prove so I’ll just continue being the mature one in this thread by thanking you for your willingness to help us promote a new series.
"Genuinely worried about peoples cognitive abilities lately. You realize almost no one is cheering on the death of babies right? Beyond the fringes, everyone thinks they're the good guys saving kids. No matter what your goal is, whether it be communication with, convincing or even total destruction of your political enemies - understanding how their minds work is critical. People are working with entirely different sets of information, it's the older generations job to help provide good information. I cannot believe the side of ""the institutions are indoctrinating our youth!"" seem incapable of understanding what indoctrination is."
I am also glad to hear that my position is clear as I am writing it in near perfect English for all to read: I do not believe college students belong on blacklists.
So why exactly are you tagging them- LOL. Would you like a direct contact to management? Help me help you.
"It's always been my biggest frustration watching 50 year old MSM journalists cancelling teenagers for stupid opinions. Your job is to guide young people - not destroy their lives for not having it all figured out. Young people are idiots, what's new. The old guard got the shield of the pre-social media age for their growing pains, and now get to act like saints while weaponizing the broadcast lives of the youth against them."

Most Iowans I know now refer to never Trumper as “the $95k man.” What a loser!!!
"As a Christian, here are three reasons why you should support Donald Trump for president again in 2024: 1) Trump fights for religious liberty - As president, he signed numerous executive orders defending religious liberty. He cares about your right to live by your values, pray freely, and the church’s right to speak truth to culture. 2) Trump supports the nation of Israel - As president, he kept his campaign promise to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Others promised this, but he delivered. 3) Trump is staunchly pro-life - He is the first president to speak at the March For Life Rally in D.C., and he appointed three Supreme Court Justices that overturned Roe V. Wade. He is the most pro-life president America has ever had. President Trump is the candidate with the best chance to win the general election who has a proven track record of fighting for our Judeo-Christian values."
"As the founder of Pastors For Trump, I can confidently state that I didn’t receive $95k from the Trump campaign. Real faith leaders support . Shame on . Pastors4Trump.com 🇺🇸"
WATCH: Fake Evangelical leader Bob Vander Putz admits that his organization got paid $95k by the DeSantis Super PAC. No wonder he endorsed DeSantis. Fortunately his endorsement doesn’t matter!
"Bob Vander Putz is nothing more than a snake oil salesman and an anti-Trump grifter. Real faith leaders stand with . Fortunately , like his bf , have no influence over the people of Iowa. Trump delivered for Iowa and Iowans will deliver him a victory in 56 days."

Instead the judge said the bond should be modified. Jenna Ellis is such a crybaby fraud. She has decided to team up with Fani Willis to target Trump and Harrison Floyd , an innocent black man and US Marine. Jenna is trying to get this innocent black man locked up 2 days before Thanksgiving simply because he stayed loyal to Trump. Jenna Ellis is demonic."
"I’ve been saying this for quite some time. has become one of the best MAGA allies in congress. Typically when a Republican goes to Washington they become more liberal, Elise became more conservative. We are lucky to have her on our side. Bright future! MAGA! "

Trump is right. Karen Reynolds is the most unpopular governor in America. She is also a moron for backing Rob DeSantis’ failing campaign. You can’t fix stupid!
"It’s being reported that Bob Vander Putz, a fool who lost the governors race in Iowa twice, is planning on endorsing Rob DeSantis today. Bob’s organization also received tens of thousands of dollars from DeSantis’ super pac. Totally not pay for play!! Anyway, Karen Reynolds’ endorsement won’t save Rob. And two time loser won’t save Rob! Iowa backs Trump!"

Voting is the cornerstone of Democracy. The 8th Circuit ruling is a clarion call warning all who love Democracy that Republicans scheme to “win” before 1 vote is even cast with gerrymandering. Democrats will and restore the principle of “1 Person 1 Vote!”
"TWEEPS: Two MAGA judges gutted the Voting Rights Act by ruling that individuals and groups CANNOT sue states that violate the Voting Rights Act. Of course, this heavily impacts people of color, because MAGA knows when we vote, it MATTERS. MAGA knows, if we ALL show up, they can't win. Can we get 1,000 fast RRTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"PATRIOTS! Can we get 1,000 quick replies usin’ the hashtag to help make it the top trend so folks know the only way we can prevent MAGA extremists from killin' our democracy is by fightin' for our rights to Vote?"
"🚨BREAKING: Fulton County DA Fani Willis personally questions Trump co-defendant Harrison Floyd, seeking to revoke his bond amid accusations of intimidating witnesses through social media posts. Floyd, indicted with Trump in the Georgia election interference case, faces a state racketeering charge and two felony counts for alleged involvement in a scheme to intimidate elections worker Ruby Freeman. Willis filed a motion last week, alleging Floyd's breach of release terms. His lawyers argue the social media posts weren't intimidating, emphasizing Trump's similar posts with no repercussions. They challenge the state's decision, deeming it hard to justify given the lack of action against Trump. The unprecedented move by DA Willis to directly question Floyd suggests heightened scrutiny, signaling the seriousness of the allegations. The case takes a contentious turn as the defense points to Trump's influence on social media, questioning the consistency in the legal response to similar behaviors."
Former trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson just said about President Joe Biden: “Everybody should vote for him if they want democracy to survive.” Who agrees?🤚
I hate that mass shootings have become so commonplace here that four people can get shot at an Ohio Walmart and it's barely a footnote. It's a sickness.
Jason Chaffetz claims he paid $90 for a turkey. The national average is $35 for a 15lb turkey. The real story is prices for Thanksgiving-related goods have largely DROPPED since 2022. Gas prices are down $1.70. Airline tickets are down 13%. Eggs are down 22.2%. Bacon is down 5.1%. Turkey is down 5.6%. Jason Chaffetz thinks Americans are stupid. Don't be a turkey like Jason Chaffetz.
"The outlandish ""election was stolen"" narratives become even more crazy when you consider if we had the ability to steal or rig an election, why would we leave Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul in place? Why not give ourselves filibuster-proof majorities? Ridiculous."
"If you agree that January 6th conspiracy theories are absolutely ridiculous attempts at shifting the blame away from trump supporters, then I suggest you follow us at where we have been pushing back against their BS narrative with the truth."
"Good morning and Happy Tuesday to everyone who agrees that if our votes didn't matter, Republicans wouldn't be using dirty tricks and fighting so hard to prevent us from voting. It will be MUCH worse if trump wins. That's not hyperbole. It's a FACT."
"trumpers keep trying to blame January 6th on Democrats, saying that we dressed up as them and tricked them into causing that chaos. QUESTION: Why on Earth would WE try to delay the certification of the election that WE WON??? To keep trump in office? That's absurd."
This Thanksgiving Melania Trump is grateful that Donald no longer stuffs her turkey.
"This weekend, Trump reminded Americans about the infamous ""pee tape"" which, after 2 impeachments, found liable for rape, inciting insurrection, and being indicted on 91 felony counts, his stories about ""four hookers"" seem tame. Make no mistake: Trump is a stain on our nation."
" creating the strongest jobs market in 50 years and we’re not done yet! Democrats will overcome Republican opposition to extend the Biden Child Tax Credit, invest in child care and support our Care Economy to give families the breathing room they deserve.-NP "
"If you're worried the media is insufficiently warning Americans about Trump's fascist plan called ""Project 2025,"" to remake the Executive branch if he is reelected, watch this. 🚨🚨Make sure everyone sees this:"
"I hate that my grandfather’s name is in Trump’s mouth at all, but I am not offended. For a Democrat, being mocked by Trump is high praise."
"In case you were feeling a little down today, just remember that today SCOTUS rejected the appeal of murderer Derek Chauvin, so he'll have 22 years to think about what the f*ck he did. Happy Monday."
"PATRIOTS! Can we get 1,000 quick replies usin’ the hashtag to help make it the top trend about our President's historic achievements in creatin' a mind blowin' 14 million jobs, plus heaps of union jobs?"
"President Biden often says ""the middle class built America, and unions built the middle class."" This year alone, unions everywhere have stood up to corporations and helped workers secure better wages, benefits, and working conditions. President Biden and the Democratic party are largely responsible for creating record-breaking numbers of union jobs for America. Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending on Twitter? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"

*slushing noises* d-dream… let me out of your stomach PLEASE!!! it’s been days….
you could tell me this is word for word a Jerma bit from 6 years ago and i’d believe you
"I am currently on a college campus tour. The number one topic on students’ minds, and the number one radical position they defend is transgenderism. Do I honestly believe that these 18 year olds students are fighting me because they legitimately want to see children’s genitals permanently mutilated? No. They are being systematically brainwashed by the school system and they truly believe that they are fighting to help kids. They are dangerously wrong and unwittingly supporting violence. But I do not want these students put on a blacklist. I want to face these students, as a mother, and to help them understand the abhorrence of what they are mindlessly supporting."
"You’re attempting snark, but as a matter of fact, I almost exclusively hired reformed BLM activists to work for my charity, BLEXIT. They actually proved to be the most dedicated employees to the cause because the mission was personal to them. Students can change. I am living proof of it. Cultural propaganda coupled with educational brainwash has proven potent, but not irreversible. I don’t mind your ire directed toward their administrators and professors (the root cause of their madness) but you are being entirely disingenuous when it comes to the students. You know the majority of them don’t want grandmas dead no more than I wanted grandmas dead when I refused to wear a mask during covid propaganda season. If we’re being honest, the majority of them can’t even point out Israel on a map."
"I will again restate that is unlikely that the majority of the college kids were taking to the streets to explicitly “cheer murdered babies”. They instead believe they are fighting for some other righteous cause. While misguided, they are in need of education, not black lists. I would also like to highlight your inherent pettiness and immaturity for tagging the Daily Wire."
"I started my political career at Turning Point USA for a reason because I intimately understood how the left had brainwashed me to hold what I now recognize were the wrong positions on virtually everything— from race to human life. Turning Point held the righteous idea that conservatives could win on the basis of our ideas, showing up to debate and changing minds on University campuses. If instead their prevailing philosophy was “all leftist students are irredeemable and should be put on a list for not agreeing with us”, I would have never joined the organization. Conservatives are losing the plot. While I passionately disagree with these students on virtually every issue, putting leftist students on blacklists will all but guarantee that they hold resentment and never come over to our side on any issue. That isn’t a solution, it’s a future problem."
It’s one of my biggest gripes with the pro-life movement to this day. They call young women “baby murderers” as if these young women aren’t systematically learning in school that it’s a clump of cells and that it would be selfish of them to carry through with their pregnancies. Hysterical rhetoric and heavy accusations never helps to bring people to your side. Both the left and the right are guilty of it.
Nothing infuriated me more than watching black neighborhoods be burned to the ground in terroristic fashion during the George Floyd riots. But I would have been a disingenuous fool had I suggested that every college kid who signed a BLM letter of support be put on a list for advocating for terrorism. They were brainwashed and it was obvious. Rather than advocating for them to have their lives ruined I used my platform to show them the truth. I created a documentary to expose media lies. Education is what conquers ignorance. Many of my former critics are fans now and virtually nobody is donating to the now bankrupted BLM organization.
"Oh stop it. This is incredibly disingenuous, Megyn. You know that many of those students are not out there because they want babies to be murdered. College kids are stupid. I used to be radically pro-choice. Glad I didn’t get put on a “conservative” black list for wanting babies murdered. As it turned out, I was just young and temporarily brainwashed from a public school education coupled with mainstreamed Hollywood lies— and not because I legitimately wanted to see infants torn from their mothers’ wombs. Dr. Thomas Sowell used to be a radical socialist who ardently supported communism. Thankfully he wasn’t put on a “conservative” blacklist and accused of being a person who wanted worldwide suffering and starvation, as socialism and communism bring. Students are young and experimenting. You are an adult woman who is advocating for their lives to be permanently pigeonholed because they have the wrong ideas which are likely being spoon fed to them in their classrooms."
The rhetoric of the elite is becoming more insane and more unhinged with every geopolitical issue. Why? Our enemies are growing stronger—regarding that there can be no doubt. No one is being convinced by hysteria amongst the elites that we are somehow justified in our pursuits so why do they continue to do it? Why do they seem to actually WANT a third world war?
"This is very much worth the read and a subsequent discussion. While I don’t agree with every point, it very much articulates how I felt watching the faux moral crusading over Ukraine being forced upon us from the elites. Why? Because the West has lost the moral high ground."
"This is such a commendable tweet. Sometimes, emotions get the best of people. We’ve seen a lot of that this week, but few have the courage or the humility to admit it. Can’t say enough how awesome this tweet is, . Class act, rarely seen in politics."
"This week at Georgia Tech, a self-identified lesbian, black, female stepped to the plate to ask me what I think about her. And I told her the truth."
"It should go without saying that if you think it somehow means less when a Palestinian child is murdered, or if it somehow means less when an Israeli child is murdered, it is likely because the media has transformed you into a monster. Innocent children should be protected."
"If there was ever any doubt, I have been and will continue to be a voice for policies that put Americans first."
"America’s priority should be defending America’s borders—not the borders of overseas nations. I don’t know how something so abundantly obvious could be considered even remotely controversial. Not a single foreign nation that we financially support has offered to help defend our southern border. So no, I won’t be manipulated into thinking that it’s our duty to defend theirs. 🇺🇸"
This week really exposed who is a realist and who has Marvel movie brain when it comes to geopolitics
Why do people love Tucker Carlson? The older class of the Republican Party doesn’t know how to deal with the fact that younger conservatives are not reacting emotionally—mindlessly agreeing to pledge billions of dollars or to enter foreign wars—no matter how shrill the screams from politicians. Every war and every tax dollar spent overseas requires a full-throated debate. No amount of ad hominem attacks makes that requirement disappear. You are not a racist or an antisemite or an islamophobe if you did not immediately acquiesce to a severe foreign policy decision based on graphic images being shared by either side. Tucker Carlson gets this. I remain a huge fan.
"I could have and should have been clearer here: I was referring to an older class of politicians and candidates in DC— the Nikki Haley types who have been virtually unhinged this week, frustrated that their unchecked emotion is unpersuasive."
A man wins woman of the year. Absolutely incredible. LOL.
"Pride month is littered with open acts of sexual deviancy. Grown adult men flying beneath the LGBTQIA banner, exposing themselves to children. “Love is love” they claim. No. Sexual deviancy is sexual deviancy. Perversion is perversion."

U really start to understand the psychology of the masses when you realize Normies secretly love burning hours of their life in traffic and waiting in long lines It’s a reprieve for them. Only time to themselves without a boss or nagging wife barking at them
Remember all those little nerds acting out their power fantasies by coming at you for not wearing a mask? First time in history they had the pretext to berate people much stronger than them with impunity Now that it’s over they have no purpose in life :(

Ur in a very fucked up headspace if you think listening to yourself over someone you love is an act of betrayal
Average dude genuinely feels guilty when he goes against the grain and doesn’t listen to the path recommended to him by his parents & peers etc Guilt is basically a terminal illness. Turns you into a perpetual people pleaser at the cost of your entire life
Why alc and drugs explodes after sunset. All the shit you don’t wanna feel haunting u
Way easier to bullshit urself during the day than it is at night when the action quiets down Ton of emotion swamps you at night when things quiet down. The shit ur not addressing plagues you Crucial to embrace this shit & take stock of ur life
Something about vigorous physical activity removes peoples self conscious filters. People start talking about what they really think & feel about shit

What the fuck is up with people putting mufflers on cars that look like they were salvaged from a junkyard. We already knew you were broke. Now ur screaming it from the rooftops

One of my favorite comedians weighs in.
"Josh Kruger—allegedly—“mentored” the young man who murdered him. He also (allegedly) got him addicted to drugs, forced him to perform sex acts on him and threatened to put those videos out publicly if the teenager did not do all that he asked. Josh Kruger was hailed as a community leader and hero in Philadelphia, while spewing disgusting rhetoric to conservatives full-time over the internet."
"I will never stop screaming about the obvious slippery slope of transgender ideology to pedophilia. It is bizarre that so many adult gay men tirelessly advocate for this ideology while demanding access to children to teach them about sexual identity. People are scared to be called transphobic, I am not. I literally could not give a shit less when it comes to exposing pedophiles."
"A 39 year old gay man tirelessly advocating for children to be exposed to gender ideology. I can’t say this enough— if ever there were a red flag of someone to keep your kids away from, this is it. Turns out Josh Kruger was himself, a pedophile, now murdered by his victim."
The Left stays committed to its false narratives forever. They're still pushing the Matthew Shepard martyrdom story even though it's well established and beyond dispute that Shepard was a meth head and drug dealer who was murdered by another gay man over a drug related dispute.
"Tucker drops new clip calling Nikki Haley a “child” throwing a “tantrum” when she says America was attacked (we weren’t) & that we should “finish” Iran “This is not sober leadership” She is “ignorant” & “bloodthirsty” Tucker was great at Fox, but Tucker on X is next level!"
"Lindsey Graham, a sitting US Senator, has just casually declared that the United States is in a holy war. Absolutely reckless and insane."
"Leaders, in particular, need to be able to think critically and rationally, even when faced with difficult challenges. They need to be able to weigh different perspectives and make decisions that are in the best interests of all, not just their own supporters."
"And to be clear, before anyone tries to misconstrue my words— I have always explicitly been against Nikki Haley and warmongering, I have always been explicitly against Ukraine, Afghanistan, and virtually every other military industrial concoction that demands American bloodshed and an infinite amount of taxpayer funding while using emotional arguments to stipulate that we have no right to ask questions."
"I agree. This week, a lot of people resorted to outlandish emotion void of critical thought and analysis. This is why most people are not suited to be leaders. Twitter dialogue descended into barbaric grunts. In time, many will come to regret having let raw emotion trump their rationality in a time of crisis."
What books are you guys reading right now? Have some upcoming travel and want to cook through a few.

"Fox News ran this White House press briefing, but stopped coverage before the drastically lower prices of airline tickets, car rentals, eggs and bacon were listed. Make sure EVERYONE sees this."
"This is DISGUSTING, even for Trump: Former President Trump mocked former President Jimmy Carter at an Iowa event, just one day after the Carter family revealed Rosalynn Carter's entry into hospice care. Trump, criticizing Biden in Fort Dodge, Iowa, quipped, ""the happiest person anywhere in this country right now is Jimmy Carter because his administration looked brilliant compared to these clowns."" He added, ""Compared to Biden, Jimmy Carter was a brilliant, brilliant president."" The Carter Center announced the former first lady's hospice care last week, a service often chosen by patients nearing the end of life. President Carter entered hospice care in February, and in May, the family confirmed Rosalynn Carter's dementia diagnosis. While Trump's remarks drew attention, they occurred against the backdrop of the Carter family dealing with Rosalynn Carter's health challenges. The former first lady's passing, following her entry into hospice, adds a somber note to the political commentary, emphasizing the importance of sensitivity when discussing public figures, particularly during personal and challenging times. Notably, the Carters enjoyed a 77-year loving and faithful marriage, with neither facing felony charges nor attempting to incite insurrection against America."
Happy Birthday Mr. President!!! Let's keep the good times rolling in 2024! 🇺🇸💪
"Moms for Liberty Not Sending Their Best: Philadelphia's Moms for Liberty chapter faces scrutiny as their faith-based outreach coordinator, Phillip Fisher Jr., a Republican pastor, was convicted a decade ago of sexually abusing a teenager. Leading the Center of Universal Divinity, Fisher connects the group with local faith leaders to boost membership. Shockingly, Fisher pleaded guilty in 2012 to aggravated sexual abuse of a 14-year-old when he was 25. Blaming a political action committee tied to Lyndon LaRouche, Fisher alleges a conspiracy, calling it a ""railroad job."" Despite his conviction, he leads the right-wing group's outreach. Moms for Liberty's national spokesperson did not comment, leaving Sheila Armstrong, a GOP ward leader, expressing surprise over Fisher's background, unaware as she obtained a ""child abuse history certification"" for him. Fisher served nearly 20 months in jail before pleading guilty to the three-year sentence, citing violence from fellow inmates as motivation. His past is accessible on the Illinois State Police sex offender database and the U.S. Department of Justice's National Sex Offender Website. This revelation poses challenges for Moms for Liberty, raising questions about their vetting process if they're hiring convicted sex offenders for outreach when that information is readily accessible."
"It is not going well for trump's lawyer, John Sauer, in this appeal of his gag order. These judges are SHARP, and particularly Judge Patricia Millett is not in the mood for his bullshit. Love it. 👏👏👏"
"Hard to believe lawyers are in federal court right now arguing over the right of a former President to be allowed to threaten private citizens and officers of the court, but here we are. trump should be in JAIL for repeatedly violating his gag order."
"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who has ZERO interest in considering 3rd party candidates who have no chance of winning in 2024. Like it or not, that's the very real choice we're facing: President Biden or trump. Joe Biden has beaten him before. He'll do it again."
REMINDER: Polls don't vote. People do. PASS IT ON.
"Today, we mourn the loss of First Lady Rosalynn Carter, a devoted wife and public servant revered for her compassion and for the transformational change she brought to mental wellness and to caregiving, inspiring people around the world to work towards a better future for all. Our prayers and love are with President Carter, their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May she rest in peace. -NP"
"Republicans are desperate to distract from their failed policies, so they're trying to convince America that January 6th was not violent with newly-released footage. But if it was violent, they say it was Democrats' fault. The conspiracy-overrun GOP is unfit to lead."
"I don't think enough people are concerned that if trump gets back into office, we may never have another free election again. And before you say ""that will never happen,"" that's what they said about trump in 2016, and Roe v Wade. This is not a fucking game."
"Rest in peace to former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who sadly passed away at age 96, with President Carter right by her side. She helped revolutionize the role of FLOTUS, and she was referred to as “The Steel Magnolia,” as she was at one point considered possibly the most powerful First Lady in U. S. history. President Carter sent her on major diplomatic missions and often had her join cabinet meetings. One of President Carter's aides had listed his top advisers, and put her above Secretary of State, National Security Adviser and White House Chief of Staff. A Time magazine columnist wrote, “Note the order.” She was the first with an office and issues staff, and steered policy on many issues, including mental health. Rosalynn Carter gave her first address to the World Health Organization, and stated that health is a human right and called attention to mental health as a critical part of a person's well-being. Rest in Power, FLOTUS. 🙏💙"
"I stopped watching Bill Maher years ago because he's an asshole. He stopped being funny a long time ago, he's always complaining about wokeness and other issues the right wing cares about, and he only trends on Twitter for having said some stupid shit. I'd rather watch paint dry than watch his right wing pandering garbage."
I'm old enough to remember when things like marital infidelity would turn voters off completely. But we're in a warped reality where trump is being rewarded for disloyalty to his spouse and to his country with the unchallenged leadership of the GOP.

"🚨🚨🚨 A week ago, I filed an ethics complaint against Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron for his partisan antics, bias, and railroading of President Trump. After my complaint, a New York appellate court smacked down Judge Engoron for his blatantly unconstitutional gag order. Today, I’m supplementing my ethics complaint against Judge Engoron with examples of even more of his egregious misconduct after he just wrongly dismissed President Trump’s motion for a mistrial. Read the supplement to my judicial complaint in full below. November 17, 2023 New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct 61 Broadway, Suite 1200 New York, New York 10006 Re: Judicial Complaint Against Judge Arthur F. Engoron Supreme Court, New York County Case Name: New York v. Trump Index No.: 452564/2022 Dear Commission Members: On November 10, I filed an ethics complaint against Judge Arthur F. Engoron. Please supplement my complaint with President Donald J. Trump's publicly available mistrial motion he filed on November 15, which I have enclosed and Judge Engoron just wrongly denied. Sincerely, Elise M. Stefanik Enclosure (available at , last accessed Nov. 17, 2023)"
"The that just released prove that everything the Democrats told you about January 6th is a complete and total lie! , , and the other scum bags that were on the J6 Committee should be subpoenaed!"
January 6th was a complete and total HOAX!!!
The police facilitated January 6th This is why they withheld the tapes The J6 committee should be censured and expelled for lying to the public
This is incredible. Just imagine how pissed the Murdochs are after watching this 😂😂 Fox has tried so hard to promote desantis and Haley but their viewers still want ! MAGA!
"My friend has really triggered the desantis “influencers” today because she exposed the fact the “influencers” are bought and paid for. DeSantis has no organic support and his “influencers” are non-influential hence why he has fallen into 5th place in NH and third place everywhere else. Keep up the great work, LL! MAGA! 🇺🇸"
"BREAKING: All 44,000 hours of footage from January 6th has been publicly released by House Speaker Mike Johnson. View the J6 tapes here: "
"Address details that were public already? No, we wouldn’t do a story on that. Will your friends at Chronicles not publish something for you? Sad! We do, however, have an interesting article coming about a Marxist anchor baby who is the child of a murderous illegal migrant. 👀"
"Listen to explain how electric the crowd at was when walked out with , , , and . MAGA! 🇺🇸"
Tiny man on tiny stage in front of tiny crowd.
Another great reason to vote for !
"The people are waking up, even the youth! We all want back in the White House because we want to make America safe again, make America wealthy again, and make America great again! Very cool 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
"Karen Reynolds hurt Rob DeSantis, just as I predicted when she endorsed his failing campaign a couple weeks ago. Karen is the most unpopular governor in America."
Trump-Tucker 2024. Save America!
"Jebba Ellis, aka the dumbest attorney in American history, blocked me. This grifter hates being called out! To my followers that aren’t blocked, have fun trolling Jebba. She’s very easy to trigger!"
The gag order was unconstitutional to begin with and this case is total BULLSHIT. Election interference!!

BIG THINGS HAPPENING IN BLISSED CORD GET IN HERE 
Nature is so beautiful ❤️
There’s immense power in believing everything that happens to you is your fault Cause then when someone else blames you for something you know for a fact it’s not your fault
Very uncanny how it’s always someone you look 300x better than asking you isn’t all that steak n butter you eat bad for you
It’s always a bull market when you’re talented
All I know is positive self talk seems to be very well suited toward employees & people who hate their current situation as a way of coping with it Champions seem to be bred purely on negative self talk & telling themselves not to be a bitch.
That time I launched a decent house in the Midwest on a hothead tennis player
A lot of dudes fall in love with the process so much they purposely fail over and over again so it guarantees their continued stake in the process They don’t even want to succeed. They just enjoy the revolving door of the process. Ridiculous trap
"Increasingly clear that nature is a million X more powerful than nurture Ton of dudes burned their whole youth sitting in the wrong classes, taught the wrong history, groomed to be docile employees couldn’t be indoctrinated. Still broke the mold. Sidestepped all the landmines"
"The mind & body are inseparable matrices Can flood ur body with all the synthetic T you want, your mind will still be left behind despite whatever supposed cognitive benefits T apparently gives Which can’t be much. Cause all the roidmonkeys I’ve met are morons"
The T level thing will eventually get rolled on as the biggest sham of our time It’s as fake and gay as everything else in science Isolating a substance as the holy grail when the totality of the human animal contains intangibles like force of will Big mistake
It used to be that women were scared of the window closing on them to have kids Now it’s men. Ton of guys who failed in every department of being a man doing the father LARP as the final bastion of signifying their dying masculinity Desperation never delivers
Many cases of yung guys afraid to be a beginner cause they wanna be the best before they even start Leads you to adopt the mannerisms & speech of those you look up to to pretend you’re an expert Leads to massive stress trying to uphold it & you’ve still done nada
People bash overcompensating cause it terrifies them that other people aren’t terrified of overcoming their natural deficits No shit a short guy wants a Ferrari. The fuck else is he supposed to do? Accept his shortcoming? Fuck no
Strip a man of his desire to conquer and all he’s left with is exhaustion & sleep
"The people who always told me to respect money, never earned any. I have no respect for money, it’s infinite, abundant - the central banks have proven it. This is why I burn thousands of $ worth of candles & cigars every month. Definition of burning money."
Not dating chicks till you hit x amount of dollars or x statistic is one of the wildest copes out there If you won’t do it now I can guarantee you you won’t magically do it when u hit ur mark Should be doing everything on the comeup you’d be doing if you struck it big
U pass by places all the time & tell urself you won’t go inside till you have a fatter bankroll or a different set of life circumstances That’s the indicator you should going inside those places now. Trust me
Most men can’t fathom the power they’d have in 1 year if they went all in on their natural strengths & stopped addressing weaknesses Flaws are easily shrouded when you go all in ur natural talent Addressing weaknesses keeps you at the kitty pool cranking small levers

"If January 6th was such a peaceful gathering and NOT an insurrection, why was domestic terrorist Ashli Babbitt shot while trying to climb through a window busted by ""peaceful tourists?"" Why were people trying to gouge the eyes out of police officers? Why were both Republican and Democratic members of Congress forced to shelter in place while people tried to bash the doors in? Why was there a gallows brought there while people chanted ""hang Mike Pence?"" Why did they evacuate Mike Pence? Why was Josh Hawley running for his carpetbagging life? Why was fecal matter smeared on the walls? Why did Laura Ingraham and Don Jr frantically try to get Mark Meadows to get trump to stop the violence? So many questions."
"Lmao, our little Kobe thinks she's helping us decorate the Christmas tree on . 😻 😹"
"With President Biden’s leadership and the slimmest of majorities in Congress, Democrats delivered lower prescription drug costs — including capping insulin costs at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare. 1 in 5 US seniors in America is diabetic, but every Republican in Congress said NO to helping them — and Republicans even SUED to repeal these savings and raise the price of insulin back up. Not on our watch, ! -NP"
"I've noticed that there is a huge disparity in which content is considered sensitive on this site in the past year, and it's disturbing. The replies to my tweets are filled with troll accounts that repeatedly post content that is supposed to be in violation of Twitter rules, replies using homophobic slurs, threatening violence -- and Twitter keeps saying ""we didn't find it in violation blah blah"" Meanwhile, I see dozens of replies to me that are completely innocuous, tweets that are flagged to contain ""sensitive content"" when it's only a GIF saying ""Democracy Rules"" or someone high-fiving. It's clear that Musk is busy promoting hateful, antisemitic content and he's punishing left wing content. I hope Media Matters and other outlets get to the bottom of what's really going on."
"Good morning and Happy Saturday to everyone who is glad that the judge in Colorado ruled that trump DID commit insurrection, but confused and pissed that he's leaving him on the ballot because Presidents are excluded from section 3 of the 14th amendment? Makes no sense to me."
"In the recent J6 tapes released, they want to gaslight us into forgetting what we saw: - Cops beaten by flagpoles & fire extinguishers - Cop crushed in door - Panicked messages from Laura Ingraham & Don Jr begging Meadows to get trump to stop the violence I remember all of it."
"Here’s the Republican Party, in their own words, telling you exactly why you should vote for Democrats in 2024. Make sure everyone sees it."
"Since trump supporters are so convinced that January 6th was just a peaceful tour, I can't wait to see the released J6 tapes that show which peaceful tourists made ""tough guy"" Senator Markwayne Mullin crouch and hide in terror like this. Will be wild!"

"Despite the non-stop firehose flow of awfulness from trump-related insanity, I have to consciously resist the urge to become jaded, to lose my sense of outrage because there is just SO MUCH awful every day. Once we stop being shocked and outraged by it, it becomes normal."

"🚨Trump's Fraud Witness FLOPS: Like everything else in his orbit, Donald Trump's defense is unraveling miserably in his civil fraud trial in New York City, as an expert witness, Steven Laposa, seemingly contradicted himself under intense cross-examination. Laposa, who was testifying in favor of Trump, aimed to refute what he labeled as the State's ""flawed"" interpretation of Trump's financial documents, as reported by ABC News. The real estate expert had previously argued that the State mistakenly relied on the market value of Trump properties, claiming it to be significantly lower than their actual investment value. However, on Friday, Attorney General Letitia James' attorney, Louis Solomon, pulled out Trump's financial document and demanded Laposa read from its notes section. Shockingly, the note stated, ""Assets are stated at their estimated current values,"" leading Laposa to admit, ""First time I've seen this."" Solomon then confronted Laposa with a definition of ""Estimated Current Value"" and questioned whether it was the same as market value. In a stunning revelation, Laposa replied, ""It could be."" This revelation directly contradicted his earlier stance. The tension escalated when Solomon presented a video deposition from July 19, 2023, where Laposa had unequivocally testified that the two terms were synonymous. The implications of Laposa's flip-flop are substantial, considering that the trial revolves around Attorney General James' $250 million complaint, alleging that Trump inflated the value of his assets to deceive lenders and investors. While Trump vehemently denies any wrongdoing, the judge had already found him liable for fraud in a summary judgment. The trial, now taking an unexpected twist, has shifted focus to the crucial task of determining damages."
"Speaking of shitty members of Congress investigated by the House Ethics Committee who deserve to be expelled, why is Matt Gaetz still a thing?"
"Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone who knows that, as BAD as it would be for Republicans in 2024 to keep George Santos around because he, as the House Ethics Committee said ""cannot be trusted,"" they should probably expel him. It's the bare minimum right thing to do."
"Sometimes I feel like I went to sleep and woke up in a deranged parallel universe, because how TF is a guy quoting Hitler and facing 91 felony counts a front runner for the presidency in a major political party? When did THOSE things become OK???"
"I know it's kinda fun to see Jenna Ellis going nuclear on all of MAGA and their ""Savior, King"" trump, but I wish she had done it way sooner. She KNEW he lost the election. She KNEW how f*cked up he is. And she went along with all of it. Now she just seems bitter. That said, I wouldn't be sad if she were able to bring down trump and his entire corrupt circle."

"Israel has a right to exist. Palestine has a right to exist. A two-state solution is the ONLY way forward. BOTH need to be free of terrorist violence, retaliatory violence, settler violence, and occupier violence. Free of violence, PERIOD. Both sides have suffered tremendous losses. No amount of killing will make it right. No amount of retaliation will feel like enough. No amount of suffering on either side is justifiable. Hamas needs to be eliminated. Netanyahu needs to lose his job. Palestine needs leadership that will push for a two-state solution. The United States, and major Arab states, need to help make it happen. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are BOTH wrong. This conflict needs thoughtful, wise voices. It doesn't need ignorant, hateful voices. There are voices on BOTH sides that are trying to amp up the rhetoric to a dangerous, deadly pitch. Don't be part of the problem. Be part of the solution."

"🚨NEWS: In a bombshell lawsuit, ex-Fox News producer Jason Donner alleges he was fired for resisting false narratives about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Donner claims he was part of a targeted ""purge"" for refusing to toe the line to ""appease"" Trump and his election-denying base. Donner was inside the Capitol during the chaos he personally witnessed, so naturally he confronted Fox's misleading reports of ""peaceful"" protesters, even calling the control room in a desperate attempt to correct the record, saying “you’re gonna get us all killed,” according to the lawsuit. He didn't stop there—he also debunked Tucker Carlson's ""Patriot Purge"" on Fox Nation, revealing the network's alleged complicity in pushing false narratives. The lawsuit details Fox's prioritization of Trump-supporting viewers, sidelining concerns about accuracy in favor of appeasing a specific audience. Ultimately, Donner claims he was unfairly targeted and fired for his dissent. Accused of irresponsibility for taking sick leave during COVID-19 vaccine recovery, he alleges discrimination based on political views. It bears noting that Fox News is already on the hook for almost $800 million dollars to settle a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for defamation. Donner, once a Republican turned Democrat, seeks unspecified damages, further exposing the internal turmoil at Fox News."
"I know I would never vote for someone who referred to me, my neighbors, or ANY human beings as ""vermin."" Copying elements of Hitler's speeches is a bad look for anyone, let alone a former President. And if that isn't immediately disqualifying for you, it says more about you than it does about him."
"🚨🚨JUST IN: The House Ethics Committee's report on Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was just released, revealing ""potential violations of federal criminal law,"" prompting a referral to the Department of Justice. The committee's statement asserted ""substantial evidence"" indicating Santos knowingly filed false FEC reports, misused campaign funds for personal use, engaged in fraudulent conduct with RedStone Strategies LLC, and willfully violated the Ethics in Government Act related to his Financial Disclosure Statements. This development intensifies the controversy surrounding Santos, already facing 23 federal criminal counts and surviving two expulsion attempts, with a third looming. The report underscores serious allegations, heightening scrutiny on Santos' ethical and legal conduct. The referral to the Department of Justice amplifies the legal challenges for Santos, further jeopardizing his political standing. Santos has steadfastly insisted that he will resist demands for him to resign, while even a plurality of his constituents and fellow New York members of Congress want him gone. ""Like I said before, I'm staying in office for sure,"" he said. ""I will take whatever comes my way, the way it comes."
"BREAKING: The House Ethics Committee just released its report on George Santos, and concludes that there is ""substantial evidence"" against him. Expel his ass."
"So-called “moderate” Republican Nikki Haley puts on full display how extreme she really is. In response to Sean Hannity asking her if she will, as President, cut ties with “these globalist organizations”, Haley says that she would: - Remove the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council. - Keep the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord. - Withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization. - Help defund the United Nations by scaling back our commitments there. Even the “moderate” Republicans are far too extreme to be trusted with power."
"Good morning and Happy Thursday to everyone who rejects the hatred from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, which has just banned ""public homosexuality,"" as part of their crusade against LGBTQ rights and whatever books they deem too scary to read. THIS BULLSHIT CANNOT STAND."
"Everyone who agrees with Republican Rep. Chip Roy, about how utterly useless the Republican party is, you and I can totally be friends."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: The Senate JUST passed the bill from the House to keep the government running, thanks to support from the Democratic party. It now goes on to President Biden to get signed. More proof that when you need to get something done, Democrats will make it happen."
"Prior to taking questions from reporters, President Biden outlined the wide range of topics he discussed with President Xi, including: - Working together to stem the flow of fentanyl - Resuming military to military contact - Discussed the impact of artificial intelligence - Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict - Peace and stability in the Taiwan straits"
"BREAKING: President Biden has just begun a press conference, following his meeting with President Xi. Watching on MSNBC now."
"Holy sh*t this encounter is amazing, and Marjorie Taylor Greene just proved in real time she doesn’t understand how Goverment works. MTG: we’ll I posted them on my Twitter account. FBI Director: I don’t spend a lot of time on Twitter. MTG: Oh I’m sure you do, because the e Department of Homeland Security, organized with other offices has censored many Americans including myself FBI Director: I’m not part of the Department of Homeland Security. MTG: Right."
Marjorie Taylor Greene is a champion of self-owns. Simply incredible. 🤣🤣🤣
"This is HILARIOUS: Donald Trump's thin-skinned and petty nature has been well-documented, so it's no surprise that his latest outburst of anger on his failing social media platform involves him begging one celebrity after being rejected by another. Jonathan Karl's latest book, ""Tired of Winning,"" is the latest target of Trump's Truth Social fury, where he called the book ""very boring."" But he also lashes out at Kim Kardashian, as one of the book's anecdotes says Trump begged her to introduce him to football players in exchange for his commuting the sentence of certain prisoners. Trump's fixation on football players seems to have stemmed from Trump suffering a humiliating rejection by the New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick when he declined to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump. Belichick, who described himself as ""an American citizen with great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy,"" was disgusted by the events of January 6th and hence wanted nothing to do with the disgraced President. So in the final days of his presidency, Kardashian attempted to secure pardons for some prisoners as part of her criminal justice reform campaign. But Trump, still hurting over Belichick's rejection, wanted a quid pro quo of introducing him to her football-playing friends. In his angry Truth Social denial, Trump claims he had no trouble getting players to come to the White House, despite the fact that 10 out of 20 teams refused to attend, and even members of the team who did attend the White House refused to come. While President Biden is focused on domestic and international concerns, Trump is focused on the small, petty things."

Rob DeSantis has DROPPED in Iowa since Iowa Governor Karen Reynolds endorsed his failing campaign. Rob and Karen are two losers that used Trump to get elected and then sold out to the Uniparty! Iowa is MAGA country.
Not shocking that Karen Reynolds’ endorsement has hurt Rob DeSantis. Karen is the most unpopular governor in America. Iowa loves Trump!
Donald J. Trump is the only one that will hold the CCP accountable and stop them from taking over the world. Trump 2024.
"The media has spent days freaking out over Trump’s comments about sending his DOJ to investigate democrats. They are saying that Trump’s comments and threats are “dangerous.” Meanwhile, the media has cheered on Joe Biden every time he has directed his DOJ to indict Trump even though Trump has committed no crimes. The fake news media is destroying our great country!"
"Rob DeSanctimonious has until Dec. 12 to remove his name from the Florida ballot or face losing his home state by 40+ points, ending his political career."

"Last night hundreds of Democrat activists were violently assaulting Capitol Police officers outside of the DNC HQ in Washington DC, only one arrest was made. The Biden DOJ arrested THOUSANDS of Trump supporters who were peacefully waving flags at the Capitol on J6. Two tier’s of justice!"

Will the Biden DOJ throw the people assaulting Capitol police in pretrial solitary confinement and torture them for months?! Or do they only do that to the Trump supporting grandmas and grandpas who waved flags at the Capitol on J6?!

"The more people hear from Rob DeSantis, the less they like him. What a failure."
"Biden is the sugar daddy of terrorism. First he opened our border allowing hundreds of potential terrorists to flood into our country, then he gifted the Taliban billions of dollars worth of the top military equipment and weapons in the world, and now he is giving billions to Iran. Trump on the other hand, put tough sanctions on Iran, eradicated isis, prevented terrorist attacks on American soil, and the Taliban didn’t kill a single American for the final 20 months of his administration Bring back Trump!"

"I’ve been calling Jebba Ellis out for many months. Some MAGA friends thought I was being too harsh, but now they all are saying I was right. Jebba is a grifting, disgusting, liar, who used President Trump to get “famous.” She was never a true believer. She was also always the dumbest person in the room and everyone thought that of her. She has zero credibility, don’t believe a word that comes out of her mouth."
Jebba Ellis is a complete and total disgrace who has no credibility whatsoever. She would say anything for a little bit of fame or attention. Jebba is also the worst and dumbest attorney in the history of America.
"Strength of leadership matters. And the world is less safe when America has a weak leader. Having a strong leader in the White House is critical to having a safe and secure world. When Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office he will create a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine on day 1. He will make China pay for unleashing COVID into the world, destroying businesses and economies on every nation on earth. He will sanction Iran and work with our allies to eradicate Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations that seek terror on the people of the free world."
"As President Trump said, if you want peace, love your nation. The future cannot belong to those who wish to eradicate borders, erode the free enterprise system, and destroy the working class. The future belongs to those as committed as ever to preserving free, democratic, and independent nations. It was a honor to speak at the first BuildUpKorea.org summit in Seoul. I felt like I was at a MAGA Rally. Korea loves Trump!"
"The people of the free world want back in the White House. And on November 5th, 2024, Americans will vote to make America Great Again, and the world safe again!"
I joined the last week to discuss the ongoing situation in the Middle East and possible solutions.

"Naturally, in this hyper-charged reality where trump's cult followers are ready to do violence, leaks like this could jeopardize testimony from future witnesses in any of the cases, and that would be terrible. As such, I hope the DOJ acts accordingly to prevent future leaks."
"If you're looking forward to more members of the trump chump club cutting their losses and spilling the beans to the prosecution, then I suggest you follow us at where we are closely following the developments in all cases that have legal jeopardy for trump."
"BREAKING: Jonathan Miller, the attorney for Misty Hampton (one of trump's co-defendants in the Fulton County RICO case) just admitted to leaking the confidential witness videos of Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell to the media. He said he only released it to one outlet. Frankly, I think we should have access to more video clips like these, of course if there weren't so many dangerous trump loons out there threatening the lives of witnesses."
Caption this picture of Senate tough guy Markwayne Mullin. Best one wins.
"This is INSANE: Instead of admitting he was heated and got carried away during the now-infamous near-brawl during a Senate hearing, United States Senator Markwayne Mullin has doubled down, and blames the averted fist fight on ""political correctness."" During the hearing, Mullin had been reading ""mean tweets"" posted by Teamsters President Sean O'Brien when he suddenly proposed that they settle their differences with a bare-knuckles brawl, which Senator Bernie Sanders defused, despite Mullins' repeated attempts to schedule a fight. Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed Mullin, asking him why ""woke"" society wouldn't let him settle the dispute with his fists like in the good ole days, and Mullin blamed it on ""political correctness."" “All of a sudden you got to worry about somebody’s feelings but oh, by the way, the left can say whatever they want,” Mullin said. It should be noted that Senator Mullin fought in three mixed martial arts fights. He lost all 3. His total fight time was less than 10 minutes, and he fought a total of less than three full rounds."
"LMFAO, Hunter Biden just filed a legal motion to subpoena trump! That's how you fight back. I LOVE IT!👏"
"This is GREAT: Marjorie Taylor Greene tries to age-shame Rep Rosa DeLauro, who promptly gives her a ""basic lesson in civics."" If you watch nothing else today, watch this. 🔥 "
"Good morning and Happy Wednesday to everyone who agrees that it is disgraceful for a United States Senator to disrupt a Senate hearing, the way Markwayne Mullin did, as he tried to pick a fight with a witness. He has brought dishonor to himself, the Senate, and his constituents."
BRAVO to the Senate Rules Committee for advancing a resolution allowing the Senate to finally get around that jackass Tommy Tuberville and confirm ALL of the military nominations and promotions.👏 Military readiness shouldn't be a political football.
"Members of Trump's inner circle, like Jenna Ellis, admitted he NEVER had any intention of leaving office, whether he won or lost. Details of Project 2025 indicate that he may NEVER leave if he gets back in. A 2nd Trump presidency is a clear and present danger to democracy."
"Matt Gaetz, who has zero ethics, has filed an ethics complaint against Kevin McCarthy, also zero ethics. You can't make this shit up."
I can honestly say I have never seen a day like today where GOP members of both chambers of Congress almost came to blows. And they have sunk this low because their leader made it acceptable for people to be their worst selves.
"If you're appalled by the thuggish behavior of Republicans in Congress, I suggest you follow us at where we prefer character over chaos, responsibility over recklessness."
"When trump supporters try to say you're lying when you say because he lifts most of Hitler's speech material, show them this:"
You all are trying to get trending as if that's somehow not exactly what his base loves. Why do you think Desantis essentially welcomed Nazis in his state? Why do you think Ben Shapiro has been all but kicked out of the inner GOP circle?
" should trend, because he does."

"🚨🚨🚨 I just filed an official judicial complaint against Judge Arthur Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York’s disgraceful lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization. Americans are sick and tired of the blatant corruption by radical Leftist judges in NY. All New Yorkers must speak out against the dangerous weaponized lawfare against President Trump. Read my full complaint below. November 10, 2023 New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct 61 Broadway, Suite 1200 New York, New York 10006 Re: Judicial Complaint Against Judge Arthur F. Engoron Supreme Court, New York County Case Name: New York v. Trump Index No.: 452564/2022 Dear Commission Members: I write today to express my serious concerns about the inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance shown by Judge Arthur F. Engoron in New York’s lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization. This judge’s bizarre behavior has no place in our judicial system, where Judge Engoron is not honoring the defendant’s rights to due process and a fair trial. These serious concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is the leading candidate for President of the United States, and it appears the judicial system is being politicized to affect the outcome of the campaign. Simply put, Judge Engoron has displayed a clear judicial bias against the defendant throughout the case, breaking several rules in the New York Code of Judicial Conduct. Last year, Judge Engoron told President Trump’s attorney that the former president is “just a bad guy” who Democrat New York Attorney General Letitia James “should go after as the chief law enforcement officer of the state.” At the start of the trial, Judge Engoron infamously smiled and posed for the cameras. After the defendant won an appellate ruling against Judge Engoron on the appropriate statute of limitations in this case, the judge simply ignored the ruling. Judge Engoron entered summary judgment against the defendant before the trial even began, without witnesses, other evidence, and cross-examination. This, despite the fact there’s disputed material evidence–and there’s no victim of the defendant’s supposed fraud. Indeed, as the trial evidence has made clear, the defendant paid back the sophisticated Wall Street banks, on time, in full, with interest, as agreed. No insurance company paid a penny. And these banks and insurance companies, supposedly defrauded, continue to do business with the defendant. Yet Judge Engoron decreed before trial the defendant somehow committed fraud. Now, the judge is holding a trial–with no jury–to determine how much of Tish James’ requested $250 million in damages–with no victims–he will extract from the defendant. How does this not violate the defendant’s Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial? And Judge Engoron has made it crystal clear he doesn’t care what the defendant or his attorneys have to say. Indeed, Judge Engoron illegally gagged them. Judge Engoron told the defendant: “We are not here to listen to what you have to say.” He told the defendant’s counsel: “I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!” And Judge Engoron even threatened the defendant’s counsel if he filed a routine motion for a directed verdict: “You better not, Chris!” Judge Engoron and his staff are partisan Democrat donors. As recently as 2018, Judge Engoron donated to the Manhattan Democrats –even though Section 100.5 says that judges “shall refrain” from “making a contribution to a political organization.” Section 100.5 also stipulates that a “judge shall prohibit members of the judge’s staff” from contributing more than $500 “in the aggregate during any calendar year to all political campaigns for political office.” Allison Greenfield has served as Judge Engoron's principal law clerk since 2019. In both 2022 and 2023, Greenfield donated in excess of $500 to political campaigns. In 2022 alone, Greenfield donated “$3,335 in political donations to Democrat candidates and causes.” She’s already given more than $1,000 in 2023 to campaigns. When President Trump’s attorneys notified Judge Engoron, Judge Engoron responded by issuing an illegal gag order against President Trump’s legal team. Judge Engoron has gone on to gag and fine President Trump for merely criticizing Judge Engoron’s law clerk, which is core political speech protected by the First Amendment. If anyone in America must have the constitutional right to speak out against the judge, his staff, the witnesses, or the process, it’s a defendant going through a process he believes is politicized and weaponized against him. To gag a defendant is un-American. It’s an illegal prior restraint on the defendant’s First Amendment rights, which even the progressive ACLU felt compelled to acknowledge after another Democrat judge–D.C. Obama U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan–illegally gagged President Trump. Indeed, three Democrat-appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit have since stayed Judge Chutkan’s illegal gag order. Judge Engoron put his judgment in serious doubt by issuing a summary judgment citing as evidence of fraud that the Trump Organization said Mar-a-Lago is worth between $426 and $612 million. The Associated Press reported that two top Palm Beach-area real estate agents said that the club’s “sale of a billion dollars or more would be possible.” In fact, Judge Engoron ridiculously found Mar-a-Lago was only worth somewhere between $18 and $27.6 million. Any Zillow.com search shows that nearly 20 acres of prime real estate in Palm Beach, touching both the Atlantic Ocean and the intracoastal waterway, is worth exponentially more than $18 and $27.6 million. And Judge Engoron had in his hand the sworn deposition of Palm Beach real estate agent Lawrence Moens, who said the Trump Organization’s valuations were “reasonable and below my estimate for the market value of the property each year.” Moens was asked in his sworn deposition about what sort of buyers would purchase Mar-a-Lago, and Moens responded: “I could dream up anyone from Elon Musk to Bill Gates and everyone in between. Kings, emperors, heads of state. But with net worths in the multiple billions.” The judge wrote: “Obviously this Court cannot consider an ‘expert affidavit’ that is based on unexplained and unsubstantiated ‘dream .’” Judge Engoron apparently doesn’t understand that expert opinions aren’t “dreams.” And this is yet another example why Judge Engoron demonstrated bad judgment by keeping this case, instead of sending it to the expert judges in the Commercial Division where it belongs. Judge Engoron’s bizarre and biased behavior is making New York’s judicial system a laughingstock. Former Southern District of New York federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, who has at times criticized President Trump, recently stated that he views the “whole New York justice system” as “fraudulent.” Section 100.2(A) states: “A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” Judge Engoron has grossly failed to do this. The Commission’s sanctions against Judge Engoron are necessary to bring back credibility to our great state’s legal system. All Americans, including political opponents, must receive due process and equal protection under our U.S. and New York Constitutions. Judge Engoron’s disdain for President Trump and his politics are evident, and the Commission must take corrective action to restore a just process and protect our constitutional rights. Judge Engoron must recuse from this case. This case is so much bigger than President Donald J. Trump. If Judge Engoron can railroad a billionaire New York businessman, a former President of the United States, and the leading presidential candidate, just imagine what he could do to all New Yorkers. Judge Engoron’s lawlessness sends an ominous and illegal warning to New York business owners: If New York judges don’t like your politics, they will destroy your business, the livelihood of your employees, and you personally. This Commission cannot let this continue. Thank you for your prompt consideration of this judicial complaint against Judge Arthur F. Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York v. Trump (452564/2022). Sincerely, Elise M.

Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus just wrote a beautiful op-ed endorsing Donald Trump for President in 2024 “Let’s face it: Donald Trump is going to win the nomination. You should be doing all you can to ensure his winning the general election… I urge the Republican National Committee to end the Republican debates that only benefit ad makers and political consultants. They are unproductive and embarrassing.”
Everyone is saying that DeSantis absolutely bombed the debate last night. Three straight strikeouts for Rob!
Great night for Trump!!! When will these jokers give up?! Trump 2024!
"A Rob DeSantis donor just texted me “after that debate performance, I’m ending my support of his campaign.” This comes just 12 hours after news broke that DeSantis’ biggest donor, Robert Bigelow, is considering switching to Trump. DeSantis is DeDone."

Is Steven Avery Guilty? | Ep. 217
First episode now available free on YouTube and already close to 1 million views in the first 24 hours! WATCH: 
I watched last night. It’s a lesson in exposing the “Fake News”. Netflix has some explaining to do. “Convicting a Murderer Premiere” check it out. 
 blows the Netflix narrative wide open Steven Avery is lucky Wisconsin has no death penalty He is where he belongs
The party continues over at ! Second episode also completely free. Head on over there! 
"Wow out today September 8 New documentary series, As I watch this new documentary it is unreal about how vile behavior was over the years."
I think we can all agree that when Alec Baldwin insists that someone is innocent— as he did with — then that person is likely 100% guilty. has just never been on the side of truth. 
Been waiting all week for this! Watching Convicting a Murderer from the fabulous mind of the on . So frickin’ excited!
Watched the first three episodes on earlier today and I cannot wait for the remaining episodes to release. MUST WATCH! Nicely done 
I was more on the “he is innocent” side until I saw this . Steven Avery is a repetitive violent animal and the Netflix docuseries either incompetently omitted those details OR DELIBERATELY did so to create a viral series.

I suspect this is what faith in god is. You can’t fuck up a society without also evolving the right kind of men who will annihilate it & reimagine natural law. The response is always overwhelming
Men are natures protectors. Any time you invert a culture & make it pozzed you will inadvertently handcraft a corrective force of men who will smash it to dust Some men are impervious to insidious propaganda & on on a long enough time scale will always restore order
"The aura every man wants comes from years facing monstrous hurdles & problem solving Engraved a certain look there’s no substitute for Shoes, spray tan, TRT, teeth whitening, no cosmetics can pave over it Always know it when you see it"
"You’ll never meet an unsatisfied man who follows his conscience through and through He doesn’t need therapy, self help books etc. his conscience is the therapy When you give away your conscience to an organization or another person you become seriously mentally ill"
Now you just forced yourself to play a character you don’t even want to be indefinitely to fuel the spectacle through everyone else’s eyes. You are fucked. And disentangling yourself from it all is a nightmare
"Ppl don’t realize you can throw the mask away any time How many guys walked down the aisle day of their wedding knowing full well she wasn’t the one. 200 guests, the ring, the pageantry. They go thru with it not to let anyone else down Can still walk away in that moment"
The only way to get what you *really* want in life is by being yourself It hurts when you lose cause maybe you’re not good enough yet. Real world feedback Doesn’t hurt so bad when ur a faker and u lose. Cause you didn’t really want that anyway. It’s a psychic defense
Wake up one day and day fuck this just isn’t me. Wears you down to the bone. No amount of money or chicks will Medicate that kinda pain either. End up starting all over again. Might as well do what you really wanted to do starting now
A huge component of peoples misery later in life is getting to where they are by folllwing a path someone else laid out of them Even if highly successful it’s existentially painful for everyone who does this Spirit always knows when you’re running away from urself
The only sane way to deal with the past is avenging it. Become what you knew you could Keep the anger of your failures in the recesses of ur mind 0 sentimentalism towards it. 0 reminiscing. It’s a fact that the opportunities ahead are better than the ones you missed
"Man listening to and acknowledging lived experience, trial and error and quadrupling down on who the fuck you are without removing any negative aspects of one’s self (integration) is what a lot males in society is missing - myself included."
"Let’s be real if she beats you at chess, scrabble, or even monopoly she’ll resent you for it If u ever fuck around & play a game with a chick you have to annihilate her. It’s what she wants"
Why God’s favorite son was David God loves ppl who seem irredeemable & grapple with the darker forces of their nature Takes huge balls to break society’s rules to follow your own
“You go first and I’ll nitpick your approach” Mental framework of the inverted male summed up to a T
"Masculinity movement of past 10 years has left a colossal trail of hollow husks of men Worrying about not worrying, caring about not caring, trying not to try, scared of being scared That’s all ya got in the end Can’t learn what was always supposed to be innate"

Team DeSantis has been mind-fucked so bad they’re sabotaging their own candidate.
"God bless . It’s disgusting that the Democrats are putting the great Trump family through hell! The Trump’s are good people. The Biden’s, on the other hand, are corrupt, sick freaks!"
Rob DeSantis’ biggest donor is considering switching his support to Donald Trump “Bigelow criticized DeSantis for running a weak campaign — and said Hamas’s attack on Israel last month showed the US needed a “streetwise” leader such as Trump.” 
Incredible find by . Engoron and his crazy wife are political hacks that are interfering in our election. What a disgrace!
It’s a beautiful hat! Trump 2024!
I’ve heard from a lot of people in Iowa since I began calling Kim Reynolds “Karen Reynolds.” They think the name is PERFECT. I agree.
"Karen Reynolds failed Republicans across the country by neglecting her job as Chairwoman of the RGA. She left Republican Gubernatorial candidates terribly underfunded because she was focused on campaigning with Rob DeSantis, a man who wears higher heels and more makeup than her, instead of raising money for Republicans. She should be ashamed of herself!"
"DeSantis’ running mate, Karen Reynolds, the wildly unpopular governor of Iowa, is in charge of the Republicans Governor’s association for this cycle. Instead of working really hard to help Republican gubernatorial candidates like raise money, she spent the last few months parading Rob DeSantis throughout Iowa. Now Karen and Rob are blaming Trump. It’s almost as if Karen deliberately failed to do her job and wanted to sabotage Republicans. Not cool!"
"DeSantis has spent close to $100M on his failing effort to take down Trump. That money could’ve been used in races across the country last night. DeSantis doesn’t care about the country, he only cares about himself. Selfish. America Last."
"Weird that the bought and paid for desantis Twitter shills aren’t talking about Trump-endorsed avoiding a runoff last night in the Mississippi Governor’s race. Tate won BIG and thanked for his support! Great job, Tate!"
What’s not being talked about today by the bought and paid for DeSantis Twitter shills is the fact that Michigan Democrats lost full control of the state legislature last night.
A couple of weeks ago Trump-endorsed won the Governor’s race in Louisiana outright without a runoff. Flipping the seat from blue to red. The Con Inc. pundits and DeSantis “influencers” have completely ignored that.
"Republicans were drastically outspent because jokers like DeSantis & other anti-Trumpers are blowing tens of millions of dollars on failing primary races against Trump. If Trump’s primary non-challengers cared about our country, they would drop out, stop wasting money, get behind Trump, and focus on defeating the Democrats in 2024. Sadly, DeSantis only cares about himself."
"🚨👀 “I think Trump is too strong,” Bigelow said. “I think Trump has the momentum, the inertia, to beat him.” Trump was a “bull”, Bigelow added, but DeSantis was “dinner"" Financial Times: Ron DeSantis’s biggest donor is considering backing Donald Trump "
"I think it’s absolutely disgusting that Team DeSantis is attacking Daniel Cameron tonight. was a great candidate who ran an incredible race. He came very close in a state that has only had two Republican governors in the last 50 years. But because Cameron beat a DeSantis backed candidate in the primary, DeSantis and his running mate Karen Reynolds, who also heads up the RGA, did nothing to help him in the general. Cameron has a great political future and I’m excited to see what he does next!"
The lesson from tonight is that Republicans can only win in 2024 if is on the ballot. Trump is the only one who can get voters to turn out. Trump 2024.
Tiny Crowd for Tiny D and Karen Reynolds last night. No one cares about Cruz-Fiorina 2.0
The American people desperately miss the Trump economy. Fortunately a year from today will be President-elect once again!
Great opportunity to flip a blue seat to red! would be a massive upgrade from radical left Andy Beshear. Go vote for Cameron!

"I know people are well meaning but sometimes we really are just demonstrating a low business acumen. Every Joe Shmoe who has done a deal with a 25 billion dollar hedge fund is not being controlled by him. In fact, it’s unlikely they’ve ever even met him."
Neither Donald Trump or Vivek are “Soros plants” despite both have done deals with him in the past. Soros operated a 25 billion dollar hedge fund and has been in business since 1970. I could probably walk through your house and manage to connect you to Soros’ financial empire.
"I’m getting a little tired of the “everything is a conspiracy” hive mind. The people that think that nothing is real, everyone successful is a fake, and every person is being controlled by George Soros are equally as twisted as those who believe everything is as the media says."

"Hey Republicans in Congress: If you want to try to solve problems with your fists, them go right ahead: resign, and then you'll have time to train for for next boxing or cage match. But dammit, you were elected to be a United States Senator, or a U.S. House Representative, and that is what your constituents voted for. Senator Markwayne Mullin: so your parents mushed two first names together to make yours, that's no reason to take it out on folks. Take your temper back to the cage and pound it out. Rep. Kevin McCarthy: You HAD your chance to show off your spine by standing up for democracy, and you blew it, choosing instead to bow to trump. Elbowing someone in the back, and then running away, is a chickenshit move. America is facing a possible government shutdown, and there's a serious backlog of military promotions. Use that aggressive energy to resolve those issues, or just RESIGN and let someone else do the job. Signed, Grown-ups in America"
Senator Bernie Sanders just had to prevent GOP Senator Markwayne Mullin from physically fighting a guy during a Senate hearing today. WTF is wrong with Republicans?
"LMAO, Kevin McCarthy physically assaulted Rep. Tim Burchett in the hallway and then ran away from him, this is the cowardly, chaotic GOP folks. Republicans are in disarray."
"🚨BREAKING: Failed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was chased by one of the 8 Republicans who voted to oust him, after McCarthy reportedly elbowed him in the back. Reporters on Capitol Hill witnessed a physical altercation between Rep. McCarthy and Rep. Tim Burchett in the Capitol. Burchett accused McCarthy of giving him a ""shove"" with his elbow, prompting a confrontation. ""Why'd you elbow me in the back Kevin?!"" exclaimed Burchett. Burchett, visibly upset, labeled McCarthy a ""jerk"" and expressed surprise at the uncharacteristically aggressive behavior. As the exchange escalated, a chase ensued with Burchett pursuing McCarthy and his detail. Burchett continued questioning McCarthy's actions, demanding an explanation for the alleged elbow. Despite McCarthy's denial, Burchett stood firm, asserting, ""You got no guts, you did so."" McCarthy eventually walked away while Burchett criticized him as ""childish"" and ""a jerk."" Remarkably, this incident marks the first communication between the two since Burchett voted in favor of a motion to vacate the speaker's chair earlier this year, but it tracks with McCarthy's unfortunate but accurate reputation for being ""spineless."
"🚨Another HUGE loss for Trump: Donald Trump flops again as recent filings unveil Truth Social, his social media venture, with an astonishing $73 million loss since its 2022 launch. The company's abysmal performance is underscored by meager net sales, reaching only $1.4 million in its inaugural year and $2.3 million in the first half 2023. These dismal figures expose Trump's shortcomings as a businessman, contradicting the persona he has crafted to his supporters. The disheartening revelation stems from a filing by Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC set to merge with Truth Social’s parent company TMTG. The filing explicitly raises concerns about TMTG's viability, casting doubt on its ability to sustain operations. This financial downturn reinforces the perception that his businessman brand is a bust, and everything he touches dies."
"HEADS UP: With Republicans in charge of the House, America is hurtling towards a government shutdown this Friday. Air traffic controllers, America's credit rating, social security and SNAP food stamp benefits could all be affected. Republicans CANNOT be trusted to legislate."

It's a ridiculous idea that a guy whose Supreme Court job is to interpret laws all day long didn't know his own ethical guidelines for accepting gifts that could be seen as bribes from billionaires. I'm not buying SCOTUS' attempt to excuse his guilt. IMPEACH Clarence Thomas.
"Lmao, who did this picture of Donald trump Jr?"
"BREAKING: Exclusive recording of Sidney Powell spilling the beans in a proffer session with prosecutors, telling them she'd been in the room numerous times as Trump was informed by aides that he lost the election. "
"I don't care that the Supreme Court has released some Code of Ethics that says how they're supposed to behave and what gifts they have to report. The already knew the deal. Justice Kagan refused to accept BAGELS from her high school friends, due to the appearance of impropriety. Clarence Thomas has accepted MILLIONS in gifts from at least one billionaire, Harlan Crow Thomas MUST resign."
"This Veterans Week, we honor the undaunted courage of our military and salute the LGBTQ members who served patriotically despite Don’t Ask Don't Tell and fought to end that discriminatory policy.

"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who prefers Presidents who DON'T use the word ""vermin"" to dehumanize people, the same way Hitler and Mussolini used to use that word. That should be disqualifying for presidential candidates. Inciting insurrection should be too."
"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: In a groundbreaking move, the Supreme Court announces its adoption of a code of ethics, a response to persistent Democratic criticism of perceived corruption among Republican justices. However, skeptics question the authenticity of this ethical commitment, deeming it a potential PR stunt to salvage the court's tarnished reputation. The ethical framework is met with skepticism, especially considering long-standing allegations of impropriety, such as the acceptance of bribes by Republicans like Clarence Thomas. Critics dismiss the notion that a nonbinding code will prompt a sudden ethical transformation among justices with a history of questionable conduct. The justices, including Thomas, assert that they have always adhered to ethical standards. However, this claim is met with skepticism given the mounting evidence of impropriety. The justices contend that the absence of a formal code led to a ""misunderstanding"" about their ethical standards. The newly introduced code is positioned as a clarification of principles governing their conduct. Critics argue that the move is an attempt to rewrite history rather than a genuine commitment to ethical behavior, especially in the face of allegations of bribery and corruption. While the introduction of an ethics code is deemed a positive step, demands for accountability persist. Some argue that the only appropriate response to address the cloud of impropriety is for Clarence Thomas to resign, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive actions beyond the adoption of a code of ethics."

Rich Men North of Richmond Lost The Debate. 
"Watch all the hands go up for when CNN asks their panel who WON the debate. Last night wasn't a debate, it was a funeral procession for the old Republican Party."
I said that nobody will remember anything from the debate but very unfortunately for DeSantis this may be the one exception. It’s a memeable moment that plays right into the most common criticism against him. Worst possible scenario.
Especially when a loved one dies. Really gross to see what people become when what they didn’t work for becomes available. Absolute vultures.

"🚨🚨NEWS: In the ongoing $250 million fraud trial led by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Donald Trump and his family business, Donald Trump Jr. took the stand for the second time and possibly jeopardized the defense with his boneheaded bragging. The outcome of the civil trial against the Trump Organization has already been largely determined as fraud has already been determined, but the phase it's in now is to determine the amount of financial liability. Don Jr's testimony took a controversial turn as he admitted, under oath, that it was a ""mistake"" for the Trump family not to pursue new deals while Donald Trump was president. Trump Jr. stated, ""In retrospect, that was probably a mistake,"" emphasizing the perceived lack of credit for their business activities during the presidency. Ironically, Trump Jr. contradicted himself moments later by acknowledging that he initiated work on ""bigger picture deals"" shortly after his father's inauguration in 2017. This inconsistency raises questions about the transparency of the Trump family's business activities during Trump's presidency. Notably, Trump Jr. failed to address the numerous allegations of enrichment during Trump's presidency, amounting to a staggering $2.4 billion, as reported by Forbes. This included deals with state-owned companies in China, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, as well as controversial arrangements like a Chinese state-owned company's involvement in a Trump golf course in Dubai amid a U.S.-China trade war. The broader scope of Trump's financial intertwining with his presidency became evident, with Politico reporting instances where Trump promoted his properties, attempted to host the G-7 summit at his resort, and the extensive use of taxpayer money for Secret Service expenses at Trump properties. Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, further raised eyebrows by sealing a massive $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia shortly after Trump's departure from the White House in early 2023. These revelations underscore the intricate web of business and politics that characterized the Trump administration, and they merely scratch at the surface of the deep reserves of corruption lying underneath."

"BREAKING: Despite having a gag order in place and being fined multiple times, Trump opens his mouth yet again and launches another attack on the prosecutors and investigators pursuing him. In an unhinged and deranged post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said: ""Deranged Jack Smith, Andrew Weissman, Lisa Monaco, the 'team of losers and misfits' from CREW, and all the rest of the Radical Left Zealots and Thugs who have been working illegally for years to 'take me down', will end up, because of their suffering from a horrible disease, TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME (TDS!), in a Mental Institution by the time my next term as President is successfully completed. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" He should be put in jail for violating his gag order and continuing to attack those who are prosecuting him."
"Donald Trump's anti-Veteran rhetoric extends way before his awful ""vermin"" Veterans' Day message. He's called fallen Vets ""suckers and losers,"" and blocked amputated Vets from parades because he said ""who wants to see that?"" Make no mistake, Trump dishonors our Veterans."

"WOW, he truly is insane and delusional. According to new reporting by Jonathan Karl, despite clearly losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump apparently came to actually believe a fringe conspiracy theory that he could be reinstated well after leaving office and before the next election. Trump has been publicly airing his grievances over the last presidential election, and frequently repeats false claims that it was ""stolen."" But Trump apparently became fixated on a far-right theory that he could actually replace President Joe Biden after he was inaugurated. The idea was not based in any actual law law and was clearly unconstitutional. But it was prominently supported by some of Trump's most devout followers, including MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell. In June 2021, the Trump put out a statement that included the phrase ""2024 or before!"" at the end. In a phone call the next month, he was pressed on what he meant by that. ""You don't really think there's a way you would get reinstated before the next election?"" Trump was asked by Jonathan Karl. ""I'm not going to explain it to you, Jonathan, because you wouldn't -- you wouldn't either understand it or write it,"" Trump said. Karl learned that Trump was talking in private a lot about the baseless notion of being reinstated as President -- so much so that some of his advisers became concerned that he actually believed he could somehow force Biden out of the White House before the next election. Even his own lawyer, Jenna Ellis had to publicly rebuke it. She tweeted in 2021: ""The Constitution has only one process for removal of a sitting president: impeachment and conviction. No, President Trump is not going to be 'reinstated.'"" But that didn't and doesn't stop the former President from being deluded into believing he can somehow become president without winning the next election."
"Incidentally, many people tend to forget that at this point in the first term of his presidency, President Obama was losing to a generic Republican candidate in opinion polls, before being reelected. What a difference a year makes. "
"Is President Biden perfect? No. Should we be concerned about polls? ALSO no. It's too far out, a full year, before the 2024 election, and a lot can change. But President Biden is the most legislatively successful President in recent history, and he's still racking up wins."
"If you're sick of the way the media pushes their false narratives in order to secure more clicks and views, I suggest you follow us at where we are keeping track of the enthusiasm and optimism around President Biden and Democrats, because it matters."
To be clear: this is NOT partisan fearmongering. Everything Psaki says here is clearly outlined in Trump's Project 2025. There's a website and everything. He's saying it publicly. Act accordingly.
"I'm curious: The media is busy creating a narrative that implies the support for President Biden is lackluster, so they can have a horse race that boosts their ratings. If a pollster called you, who else ENTHUSIASTICALLY supports President Biden for reelection? 🤚"
"Good morning and Happy Sunday to everyone who rolled their eyes seeing pro-Veteran sentiments on Veterans Day, knowing damn well those SAME House Republicans don't mind our soldiers marching into harms way, but vote against Veterans benefits. And F*CK Traitor Tommy Tuberville."

Can any person with a straight face say that Ron Desantis performed well tonight?
Nikki Haley was doing well until she dabbled into foreign policy and Ukraine/Russia. She was about to cry over the possibility of not sending money overseas. Apparently it’s our moral duty to put Ukrainians over Americans.
Most of these candidates have a foreign policy that hasn’t been relevant since before Vivek was born 
Vivek choosing to be the anti-war candidate is so so smart. Republican voters want to focus on the homeland. He mentioned immigration and the border twice while discussing foreign policy 
I believe Desantis on his border answers. It’s the most authentic he’s come across all night. The “we can do both” answer from Pence and Nikki is weak. We clearly can’t. 
The difference between a hand raise and a limp wrist
This. So tired of candidates fighting the Cold War of the 1960’s. There is a real war happening at our southern border.
Nikki was doing well. Then she sent all our money overseas. Desantis “stone cold dead” line is my favorite of his from the night.
Vivek the only candidate willing to take bold positions. -No more money to fund foreign wars. -Climate change is a hoax.
"STOP TELLING US TO CARE ABOUT UKRAINE MORE THAN AMERICA. Ron once again, a non-answer."

"After three days (and countless hours) of car shopping, including maybe $350 worth of Ubers, I finally found a good one in my price range that was cleared by a mechanic. I go to the mechanic to pick it up, do the title transfer, go home. And they lost the keys to my car."
The inside of my house might be ugly to some. But you definitely can tell that I live there

"To interview Joan Baez, Joan Didion had to reach her recording company, who told her to call a number in Boston, that gave her the name of a bookstore, where someone took her name and gave it to Joan Baez’s secretary, who then saw if Joan Baez was around to talk."
Trump says that Hungarian leader Viktor Orban is now calling on “Barack Obama” to step down as President of the United States and yet somehow the media is fixated on Bidens mental acuity.
"FUN FACT: There is only one former President who still thinks that Obama is President, and this deranged former president stole classified files, incited insurrection, and is facing 91 felony counts. He is UNFIT to lead."
"Now that the state of Ohio has spoken, and the overwhelming majority want to guarantee their right to reproductive care, Ohio Republicans are moving to take that power away from the voters. Ohio lawmakers are attempting to block Judges from interpreting the passage of the amendment, and instead give that power to the Republican legislature so they can nullify the will of their voters. “To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts with , Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative,” said a mix of Republican lawmakers. “The Ohio legislature alone will consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws based on public hearings and input from legal experts on both sides.” The statement also included unsubstantiated references to “foreign election interference” by billionaires before voters enshrined abortion rights in Ohio’s constitution. The Republican Party has decided that if voters disagree with them, they will simply take away the rights of the voters."
"Trump supporter claims we were better under him are insane. President Biden created more jobs in 2 years than Trump in four, he hit a 4.9% GDP when Trump didn't hit 3%. Violent crimes and unemployment are down. Under Trump, America was dark. Under Biden, the future's bright."
"It would be sweet, poetic justice if the people who end up taking down trump with testimony are ""low level"" Mar-a-Lago workers like a plumber, a maid, a chauffeur, and a woodworker. You couldn't script that any better, unless he ended up stiffing them for their fees too."
"On Veterans Day, we give thanks to all who defended our nation and our Democracy — and honor them with investments in veterans’ earned benefits, jobs, education, and health care. We renew our vow to leave no veteran behind — and to build a future worthy of their sacrifice. -NP"
"I’m proud to be a Veteran, and I’m proud to have had a hand in enacting the leave policy at the Pentagon. The best way to thank a Vet for their service is to vote blue. Then call and tell him to eat shit. "

"Whew, this app needs a special note when folks like President Jimmy Carter are trending to let us know he's still with us, my goodness. He's still with us. 💙"
trump wants full credit for ending roe v wade. Let's give him and the GOP 100% of the blame. Remember in Roevember.
"I don't know how anyone could forget what happened in 2016, and look at Jill Stein's sudden reappearance with anything less than suspicion and contempt. A vote for her is a vote for trump."
"Holy sh*t, election-denying Trump supporters are now openly calling for a civil war if the criminal-in-chief isn't installed in the White House. This is what's at stake in 2024."
"I'm old enough to remember when members of Congress did NOT refer to each other as ""whore."" Just...wow."
"Let Them Fight: The knives are out as the ugly, ongoing feud between Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Lauren Boebert (R-CO) has escalated, with Taylor Greene reportedly openly using the derogatory term ""whore"" to describe her congressional colleague. The tensions came to a head during the House speaker election, where the two found themselves on opposing sides after the 2022 midterm elections. According to reports by Zachary Petrizzo from the Daily Beast, Taylor Greene has consistently used the offensive term to refer to Boebert, even in conversations with Donald Trump. A Republican lawmaker, familiar with Taylor Greene's use of the term, stated, ""Calling her a whore, that’s not new. She’s been doing that for a while.” When confronted about these accusations by the Daily Beast, Taylor Greene responded defensively, questioning the motives behind the story. ""Why are you working on a story? Because you like to write trash, you just can’t help yourself,"" she remarked. Despite the direct inquiry, Taylor Greene neither confirmed nor denied the use of the term but instead criticized the reporting. Her dismissive response included, ""You just love it so much, you got to create it, and make it more, and bigger, and nastier,” leaving the allegations unanswered. The exchange highlights the deepening animosity between the two Republican lawmakers and the challenges of addressing such conflicts within the party. Republicans remain in disarray."

"FRIENDS: Can we get 1,000 quick replies and retweets to get trending so everyone knows that the threat to our democracy is rising as evil fiends try to scare election workers from their civic duty with poisoned mail attacks?"
"PATRIOTS! Can we get 1,000 quick replies usin’ the hashtag to help make it the top trend so folks know we ain't gonna be intimidated by drug-laced letters to our election workers, we're too busy fightin' hard for democracy?"
"TWEEPS: Veterans have fought and died for us to exercise our rights to participate in civic duty and vote. Recently, election workers in 6 states received letters laced with fentanyl in an attempt to terrorize them and delay the process. This domestic terrorism must NOT be tolerated. Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"It needs to be noted that, by contrast, not only did trump visit a non-union shop, during his speech he told workers that they should NOT pay their union dues and leave the union, that their efforts were doomed to fail. trump is undefeated at getting things wrong."
"If you're proud of how our President stood in solidarity with striking auto workers, then I suggest you follow us at where we are keeping track of all of his wins and giving him the props he is due, but not getting, from mainstream media."

The stark reality is that if you were ready to be doing xyz you’d already be doing it If you were the kind of person who could achieve xyz you’d know already A buncha the shit you think you want is way over ur head and keeping you from doing the shit you’re actually ready for
“These hoes ain’t loyal” was always a blatant cope for never having the unvarnished love of a woman Loyalty from a woman is unmatched anywhere. U think it’s ur boy who’d help you bury a body. But it’s her. Trying to fill those shoes in the wrong beast

"The modern man’s masculinity is subjugated He does things he *thinks* will make other people think he’s a man but he can’t ever feel it Packs on muscle, bangs whores but still feels unloved. A chasm Embodies none of the qualities that make a man. Tactical not spiritual"
"Wild how this new breed of man we see uses everything as a yoke to punish himself Punishes himself through food, exercise, even sex. Unable to connect to anyone or anything Empty vessel accumulating wins so he has more to lose. Feels most at home when he has nothing left"

"I suspect you often find yourself lonely amongst men of your general pedigree, because it is rare for them to be as self-aware and cerebral as you are. So even amongst your peer outliers, you are an outlier. An island within an island. Hope you’re doing well."
"Perspective is literally the whole game Dudes with far less than you and way more problems experiencing the best of women, power, fulfillment just cause they see things differently than you"
Beyond hilarious how a lot of dudes get pissed when you do nice shit for a chick cuz they’re scared it *raises the price of all men for access to women* Dudes walking around feeling *personally betrayed* if you buy a bitch a gift. Can’t make it up

Only drug I do is tobacco cause I can still be myself on it Lesson in there
It’s the opposite. Everyone faces their fears daily Undesired ppl make themselves obese and uglier on purpose. Making their worst fear come true. Facing fears is a bullshit myth Trick is not being scared in the first place so there’s no prophecy to fulfill
Ur in purgatory. Whatever you’re afraid of is what you think you deserve. You see it as punishment. The guy who’s afraid of being betrayed always gets betrayed. He has to prove to himself he deserved it It reinforces what he thinks of himself
Self fulfilling prophecies are unbelievably real Everyone wants to make their worst fears come true so they can finally get it over with Why you can’t fear anything in this life. Everything you’re scared of will happen to you in one way or another
You think moneys gonna settle all the scores in your life? Get you revenge for all the perceived slights you’ve suffered at the hands of imaginary enemies? It won’t You’re chasing something that can’t be bought with cash If it was never in you it won’t ever be on you
Just came off one of the greatest bull runs ever & everyone was still miserable U had a buncha Money stacked but still felt dead inside. You want respect n power but haven’t been roughed up enough in the real world to get it More cash not gonna solve it. U just proved it
Good luck afflicting a man who just keeps going

People spend their ENTIRE lives running away from what they really want cause ya can’t get hurt if you lose what you don’t care you have. That simple.
There’s a very real strain of feminine narcissism that’s pervading a lot of men You can’t see yourself. You only see urself reflected back by other ppl “Is this girl perfect enough to be the kind of chick that the man I want everyone to think I am would be with?” Pitiful

"Flying in the backup fighter, kicking me out of the press conference, no face-off, and cutting all my interviews—among other things—just keep killing the buzz I have for this fight. I'm tired of the disrespect. Maybe I'll just go silent and let DAZN realize what I bring to the table."
"I'm not venting; I just truly love entertaining you guys. If you're going to spend your hard-earned money, it should be justified. The police didn't remove John Fury but removed me from the area.

I built this show; fuck all those clowns. This event is nothing without me.
"I can't sleep; I'm so frustrated for the fans. I really wanted that stare-down, to look that coward in the eyes. Logan and KSI are doing interviews because they had cops remove me. I couldn't even do my own interviews. It's so wack, man. I love entertaining you guys."

At no point tonight did Karen Reynolds endorsement of Rob DeSantis trend here on X. No one cares about a bought and paid for politician endorsing another bought and paid for politician. The people want Trump back! Trump 2024!
NEW: Pick a metaphor: President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign is a “five-alarm fire.” It’s a cardiac case in need of a “defibrillator.” Or a lemming on course to “slowly march into the sea and drown.” All come from Democratic strategists whose low-boil frustrations with Biden’s candidacy erupted over the weekend amid a spate of bleak polling numbers. w/ & team 
. and have twice as many live viewers as the Karen Reynolds Rob DeSantis event
Reynolds is wrong here. According to the polling Trump is a stronger candidate than DeSantis in the general election. Republican voters also believe Trump is the better candidate in the general election by a wide margin.
Here we go again…. 
"These two clowns ran to meet the fake press on MSDNC to trash while Trump was being politically persecuted in NY. Scummy move, scummier people."

Logan Paul and KSI both got clowned by me watch the whole press conference fuck em.
I’m killing this man in the name of the Japanese people 🇯🇵
"I was totally dominating the press conference, especially when roasting KSI and Logan. John Fury's cool, but he's not the one stepping into the ring. The conference was just heating up, and I was absolutely owning it. Honestly, I'm pretty damn annoyed right now."
Who won that press conference ?
Dillon Danis mentioned Logan’s Scam Cryptozoo 
The Dillon Danis Show.
"You got cooked verbally and with objects to the face this is such a pussy post, the police forced me to leave cause your safety you have my number I’ll meet you anywhere and do a stare down."
Shits so stupid I was just heating up I want more!
How that mic taste?
I wanted a face off with Logan Paul he called it off in fear of his life and got me escorted out meet anywhere in London pussy.
Logan “ you don’t need to take it out on my girl because my brother fcked ur ex” Dillon “ at least I got rid of that hoe you are marrying one “
Are you not entertained.

It all comes down to refusing to let anyone/anything defeat you. You’re not gonna go down and start playing for low stakes when you get crushed Ur gonna up the ante & come back twice as hard. Impossible not to win with this attitude
Here’s the greatest piece of practical wisdom u’ll hear If you skip all the new age metaphysical spiritual religious bullshit & focus 100% of your energy on health and making $$ you’ll learn everything about spirituality & metaphysics along the way & have smthg to show for it
A ton of fools unconsciously stress themselves out by letting mundane tasks pile up so they never have to fight the battles that actually matter
Gotta be able to see things for what they are before you can have them as you want them to be

Funny how people use future impending doom/stress to pause their life & do nothing Why should you still talk to chicks & duke it out in business if everything is falling apart right? Wrong. YOURE MOST LIKELY to get what you want in this state. But you freeze like a bitch
Childlike exuberance as a cope for not exploring/being unaware of the shadow
A lesson in parenting
"I go back and listen to modules from course all the time, so many gems ""Self pity and guilt are slave emotions"
"These milquetoast takes of “ they want you fat, depressed, lonely, weak, retarded” are beyond parody at this point I do not give the slightest fuck what “they” want for me. I make my own choices cause I’m a full grown man ZERO agency"
Masculinity is gay By purging your unconscious feminine aspects it leads to what we’re seeing here on a daily basis A complex that manifests itself as outwardly female behaviours and superficialities all wrapped up in a male who can’t for the life of him interact with a bitch
There’s a very zen kind of disdain you can have just looking around at who you don’t want to be anything like Should be using this as fuel to force yourself to do all kinds of shit you don’t want to do to stay way ahead of all the morons around you
Only when guys are down real bad do they descend into sexual fetishes When life diminishes u in some way u in turn lower ur standards to reinforce it It’s what porn addiction is. Powerless man validating he’s a piece of shit by indulging in smthng he wouldn’t if he was winning
"You PUA retards never calculated that because you tricked her to get her, you can’t believe her when she says she loves you. The fact she loves u means she’s not smart enough to know what love is. Then u resent her, sabotage it on purpose. Rinse, repeat"
Seen cows get herded by a little puppy dog 50lb puppy scaring the shit out of half ton cows. It’s cuz of who that dog is. He’s a wolf Puppy thinks like a predator and the cow thinks like prey really is that simple. If you don’t have this mindset ur fucked
The rule of life IMO is don’t flinch Whatever you’re doing you can probably unfuck it if it turns out to be bad. But you can’t ever flinch The mindset is way more rare than the muscles
"Never ""hoped"" for a single goddamn fucking thing in my life I'll just take matters into my own very capable hands and steer my world in whatever direction I want Keep hoping and coping pussies Nobodies coming to save you"
Ain’t it funny that the most miserable ones are still together and the ones who love each other the most are apart

"🚨BREAKING: Republicans suffer a HUGE setback to their fundraising hopes as Billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel says he won't be making any political donations to any races in the chaotic, Trump-led, loser party in 2024. Thiel was a major donor to Trump's campaign in 2016, chipping in $1.25 million dollars, but now looks back on his investment with regret. “There are a lot of things I got wrong,” Thiel said. “It was crazier than I thought. It was more dangerous than I thought. They couldn’t get the most basic pieces of the government to work. So that was—I think that part was maybe worse than even my low expectations.” The tech billionaire was further convinced against supporting Trump after hearing the former disgraced President called him a “f---ing scumbag” when Thiel refused Trump's request for a $10 million dollar donation. It's readily apparent that Trump is an anchor around the neck of the GOP, and his losing brand is dragging them all the way down."
"Most Democrats I know believe that, if one of our politicians is guilty of a crime (let alone multiple crimes) we are the first to call them out and publicly insist that they resign and be held accountable. Republicans, however, will deny that there was any crime, and then say if there was a crime, it wasn't illegal, but even if it was illegal it doesn't matter because look at what other people did. We are not the same."
"It is obscene, and an insult to the memory of all who have served, that Senator Tommy Tuberville is STILL blocking military promotions. One day away from Veterans Day. Disgraceful. 🤬 "
"Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone who knows that with yacht-owning, Maserati-driving, millionaire DINO Senator Joe Manchin leaving the Senate, it's time for us to focus on all of the winnable Senate and House races. Together, unified, we CAN do it. Who's with me? 🤚"
NEVER FORGET that this President stood tall on a picket line with the unions. AND THEN THEY WON. That's MY President. 💙🇺🇸
"Derision and ridicule are often pointed at the loudest, most extreme elements of Trump's base. But it's the quiet, rational members who deserve the most fierce criticism, because it's their complicit silence that enables him. Letting Trump hijack your party? That's crazy."
I got no time for third party bullshit. I got no time for the No Labels shit. I got no time for people who don't vote. I got no time for people who don't care. All of the above will get us 4 years of trump. And I got NO time for THAT bullshit.
Stop telling me Biden has dementia. I spent 4 days watching an entire family between the ages of 40-77 not be able to remember a damn thing about a business THEY OWNED.
The EPA is in the process of determining the strength of rules to limit emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. Sign ’s petition to insist EPA resist pro-pollution lobbyists' pressure and pass stronger limits on heavy-duty vehicle pollution. 
"Volvo's motto is ""Volvo, for Life,"" but their heavy duty vehicle engines are contributing to pollution conditions called Diesel Death Zones. Transportation stands out as one of the few sectors where pollution is on the rise, and 70% of the cancer risk from air pollution comes from diesel trucks which use the engines produced by and . Those companies made a commitment to have undertaken major pledges to cut their emissions in alignment with their environmental and health-oriented goals, but they're trying to back out by lobbying the EPA for weaker standards. It's sickening to know these filthy-rich corporations are wheeling and dealing behind closed doors to keep the standards on their engines as weak and deadly to the rest of us as they can get away with. Here's how we STOP them from doing it:"
"🚨🚨NEWS: In a major development, Michigan's Attorney General Heather Meingast made it clear to a judge that both she and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ""stand ready"" to bar Trump from the 2024 ballot due to his role in inciting the January 6 insurrection. Meingast emphasized the Secretary's commitment to upholding the state's election laws and preserving the integrity of the electoral process. The Attorney General stated, “To be clear, the Secretary of State stands ready to comply with whatever order this court issues in relation to the former president's eligibility to appear on the ballot."" This forthright stance from the Secretary of State is a blow to Trump, indicating a decisive move against him despite attempts to maintain public neutrality. Meingast's assertion that the Secretary ""stands ready"" signals thorough preparations to hold Trump accountable for his alleged role in inciting the insurrection aimed at overturning Biden's victory. The Michigan Attorney General reiterated the gravity of the Secretary's duty, stating, ""Your Honor, the Secretary takes her role as the state's Chief Elections Officer very seriously."" The assurance to comply with the court's order underscores the state's commitment to fair and lawful elections, implying a potential ban on Trump's ballot appearance. The news compounds Trump's challenges as the judge, having heard incriminating evidence against him, announced her readiness to deliver a ruling on his eligibility for the ballot in the ""next few days."
"BREAKING: A bill has been passed to charge men with murder for masturbating and spilling their semen without prior approval. LOL, just kidding. But that reaction of ""that's ridiculous"" you just had is the SAME reaction you should have when anyone suggests controlling a woman's body."

"Not all heroes wear capes. In fact, many of them are completely anonymous. In Dallas, Texas, residents of an apartment complex are exemplifying the true spirit of community by setting up a unique initiative to ensure everyone has enough to eat. Renee, a young woman residing in the complex, took to social media to share the heartwarming discovery she made in her building. “My apartment complex has a community pantry where we (residents) drop things we don’t need for those who may need it – check this out,” Renee shared in her online post. The community pantry serves as a centralized location within the complex where residents can contribute any surplus food items, fostering a sense of shared responsibility. This thoughtful gesture goes beyond just canned goods, as the pantry includes a refrigerator stocked with extra cooked meals. The community's commitment extends to their furry friends, with a dedicated shelf for sharing additional dog and cat food and treats. Renee expressed her appreciation, noting, “There’s a whole fridge too :-)” It's a comprehensive effort to address not only human needs but also those of pets within the community. Renee emphasized the profound impact of this act of kindness, stating, “It warms my heart because you never know who may be in need.” The initiative reflects a genuine sense of compassion and community support, highlighting the power of neighbors coming together to ensure the well-being of all residents, especially during challenging times. We need more hopeful stories like this! 💙"
"Hearing that fake DEM Senator Joe Manchin is not running for reelection, I wish him luck with a capital F. We have other Senate seats to focus on. LET'S F*CKING GO."
"🚨UNBELIEVABLE HYPOCRISY: In an incredible revelation, prominent Trump apologist Rep James Comer, Chairman of the influential House Oversight Committee, faces embarrassing exposure for engaging in the very ""shady business practices"" he vehemently accused Joe Biden of. The irony is staggering, as Comer received a $200,000 repayment from his brother, mirroring the transactions he condemned in Biden's case. Comer, known for relentlessly attacking Biden over allegedly ""troubling"" dealings with his brother, conducted similar transactions while in a position of power overseeing agricultural policy. Unlike Biden, who engaged in these transactions as a private citizen, Comer's actions occurred while he held a significant official role. The $200,000 routed through a dubious shell company raises questions about Comer's financial dealings. Land swaps and requests for favorable tax treatment further compound the controversy. During these transactions, Comer, a member of the House Agricultural Committee shaping farm policy and authorizing federal programs, maintained ownership of a family farm, presenting a glaring conflict of interest. Delaney Marsco, senior ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Centre, highlights the potential exploitation of political power for personal gain, suggesting that Comer may have sought to ""game a personal business advantage."" Marsco emphasizes the importance of transparency, stating that voters deserve assurance that lawmakers prioritize the public interest over personal business advantages in their legislative roles. Comer has some serious explaining to do."
Hillary had 3M more votes than trump. Joe Biden had 7M more votes than trump. I believe it's possible to see trump get dusted by double digit millions in 2024. How about YOU?

VIVEK TO CHRISTIE: HOW BOUT YOU GIVE ME A HUG AND HELP ME GET ELECTED LIKE YOU GAVE OBAMA?
Yes. He came across as very rude and unnecessary. Disrespectful to the hosts. I’m not a fan of Nikki Haley but she is performing well. Pence surprisingly fiery. (in a good way)z Chris Christie fiery in a bad way.
This debate is 🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭😭. Wow. Did not expect any of this.
Ron Desantis sounds pre-recorded. Fighting the ghost of Trump and Fauci rather than the people on stage next to him. Pence giving a lot more fight than I expected. Vivek still has the crowd.
Ron Desantis sounds like a robot. Nikki Haley went straight for the jugular with a great answer. Crowd excited for Vivek. 
I plan to watch Tucker and the Republican debate tonight. 🤷‍♀️
"Of these 4 participating candidates, who do you think will walk away the winner of the Republican debate?"
Didn’t think it would end any other way… The East is not the West.
"Vivek Ramaswamy went straight into the lion's den at CNN and dropped FACTS and TRUTH about J6 and 9/11 that the media and the Regime want to memory hole. All this despite Kaitlan Collins' haranguing, her leading questions, and overall disrespectful tone. WATCH:"
I see the election time variant of COVID is about to drop. Mail in ballots to EVERYONE! Lol. America no longer has free and fair elections. We are no different than 3rd world countries in this regard.
"Frankly, the faux outrage Vivek is receiving is coming from the military industrial complex— of which, the media is a part of. The American people know we were lied to and that the overseas wars that followed were motivated by corruption and greed."
"The United States has never been entirely truthful about what transpired on 9/11. Vivek will not lose a solitary vote for stating that truth. The media are upset because they assisted the government in its refusal to answer meaningful, longstanding questions about that day."
"HOW MANY KIDS DIED IN MAUI? 3,000 attended schools that burned down. 620 are back in school or doing zoom school. 2,400 unaccounted for. Some of them haven’t re-enrolled. But this is a way to start tracking the deaths, which are being covered up. "
"There’s never been more real news. Not being covered. During Trump era “news” had to be fabricated. Maui isn’t going anyway. Hundreds, maybe thousands of dead children. Don’t let them move on from Maui."
Thank you. Show me a single conservative who has taken more career risks speaking out against big Pharma and vaccines than me. That person doesn’t exist. I don’t play politics when it comes to force mass-poisoning children so they can attend school.
"You are angry that your candidate is floundering but are too obtuse to realize that you are a huge part of the reason why. Trying to make me out to be “pro big pharma” is never going to stick. You’ll try it anyway, because you have nothing left in the Desantis arsenal."
"Lmao. You sound so desperate. I am proudly and passionately against vaccines. I have never altered my stance, and I spoke candidly with Vivek about that public. Vivek, Trump & Desantis are all pro- medical choice. I will never waver from my stance on vaccines and I think RFK has done amazing work exposing its evils."
Sorry to hear this. I was looking forward to watching you and Vivek in action tomorrow night.
it’s my birthday 🥳

It’s fine (good! Healthy!) to have goals and ambitions but if you fall short of achieving them it doesn’t mean your life wasn’t worthwhile. Enjoying the small things that are part of a routine make the road to wherever you’re going a little easier - because life is hard! God!

Can I suggest that the mundanity of life is actually very special so things like going to the gym and playing with your dog might be the best you ever get and that’s still a good life.

This is hilarious cause every loser you’ll meet in 2022 is the off grid type Nature boys chasing waterfalls avoiding the real work Busiest killers responding in seconds
Few have remarked on this but if you have a “good chick” you don’t see yourself with long term it’s cuz shes not hot enough. Smart women are cool but beauty far surpasses it in terms of keeping a dude motivated and performing at his best
"99% of you do not need a cure for your afflictions-addictions, compulsions, quirks You need to find a way to make them meaningful & useful instead like men have done for thousands of years You tear out too many of your “flaws” you can kiss your edge goodbye"
"Understand that being Mr Positive, upbeat 24/7 makes men profoundly miserable and exhausted It’s why dudes go on benders, self destruct, fuck shit up Bc all men understand the lows are the ONLY way you can recharge & gain perspective & momentum again It’s built into the animal"
The Internet gives a voice to a lot of dudes who would have been slaves in medieval times Dudes who’d be dunking your blood stained tunic in the creek all day getting the stains out Just visualize what someone on here’s ancient role would be and it reveals all
"& relentlessly getting what you want. From the tiniest things to the biggest Most give up too easy. If I want a fuckin hot bone broth and it’s sold out, bet ur ass I’m driving 45 min In rush hour traffic to go get it somewhere else Inconvenience doesn’t stop me"
Keep fridge basically empty. Go to dope boutique farmer type markets every day and only buy what you can carry in ur hands for that day Forces you to be a name and a face. Meet tons of chicks & killers this way Stockpiling groceries for the week makes u invisible. Low energy
Dudes on more gear than the clock tower at Notre Dame
"Something life affirming About walking outside in the morning, sparking a cig, flat expression on your face You don’t exactly have something you want yet, but you know you will get it U don’t know how, but you know you will get it U don’t care how, but you know you will get it"
"Seen so many 20+ year old chicks who are not only obese, but the kind of obese there’s no coming back from Zero way to put that body back in its frame But can still go on any app and pull 1000+ of you nasty mother fuckers enabling this shit"
The loneliest you will ever feel in your life is when you’re in a real crisis. Doesn’t matter how much support you have on the outside. it’s your own battle to fight Experiencing that loneliness is where all the growth is & why people play life safe.
Hats off to this dude. Came into my group a year or so ago directionless but knew he was smart as fuck. Not surprised he built something cool as fuck
Huge difference between having no money and being broke Broke is an entire worldview that some guiding hand is supposed to come along & repair your life on your behalf Treading water praying market forces ease up on you. Permanent defense. Guaranteed obliteration
No one likes a fence-sitter. I respect the ppl with conviction who talk their shit 1000% more than a fence-sitter even if I don't agree. Fence-sitters no diff than people pleasers who are undoubtedly fake unidentifiable losers.
This was a great question and my answer is inescapably accurate
"Most men are truly under the belief that their own body and mind is their enemy Don’t trust ur ego, don’t trust ur thinking, avoid this feeling that feeling Constant death spiral of muffling what you’re naturally equipped with Don’t worry, we don’t trust you either pal"
"Nice guys suddenly aren’t so nice when it’s time to step up & have ur back in a bar fight, or ur business is going under. Nowhere to be found Know who the real nice guys are? The tyrant who gives you shit, speaks his mind, punks you He’ll give you the shirt off his back"

I've been working since I was 18 years old and Social Security and Medicare have been taken out of my paychecks ever since then. I am not about to give up my hard-earned benefits just so some billionaire can afford a third mega yacht. F*ck that.
"If you're determined to keep the GOP's greedy hands off of your Social Security benefits, I suggest you follow us at where we are fighting daily to keep Americans informed of Republicans' evil intentions yo cut benefits to give the rich tax breaks."
"During the Republican debate last night, the candidates running to be Trump's VP indicted their willingness to cut Social Security. It has nothing to do with cutting the deficit. Even Ronald Reagan exposes their lies. Make sure everyone sees this. "
1. Republicans want to cut Social Security. 2. Republicans want to cut Medicare. 3 Republicans want to impose a national abortion ban. How do we know? They keep saying the quiet part out loud. 
Good morning and Happy Thursday to everyone who is sick and tired of the media unfairly bashing President Biden because they want another dragged-out horse race like they had in 2016. They don't want boring and responsible. They want clicks from chaos.
Nikki Haley saying the quiet part out loud: Republicans will put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block if they get elected. We cannot let that happen.
"Lawrence O'Donnell just said nobody is really trying to hit trump because ""This is the debate in case trump chokes on a cheeseburger"" and I'm still laughing🤣🤣"
The clear winner of tonight's debate: President Joseph R. Biden 🇺🇸💙

Vivek Ramaswamy: Increase the supply of everything. Problem solved.🙄
Tim Scott is peddling the lie again that the XL Pipeline would make gas cheaper. And I'm stunned that HUGH HEWITT just performed the first and only fact check of the debate calling out Scott's bullshit!!!!
I didn't think I could despise Vivek Ramaswamy more than after he went after Nikki Haley's daughter. F*ck that asshole. 
"Lmao, Vivek Ramasmarmy says our need for semiconductors underscores our need to be independent from China. It's a good thing President Biden signed the CHIPs act, bringing the manufacture of semiconductors back to the United States. "

He tried to say that Biden's commitment to fighting Islamophobia somehow cancels out his dedication to fighting antisemitism.

"Did Tim Scott just call for bombing Iran? I'm sure all of the people screaming about World War 3 will line up to criticize him, right? RIGHT???"
"Tim Scott talks about ""restoring our Christian values"" as important to improving the nation. What about all the rest of us who aren't Christian? GTFOH with that religion bullshit."

See you soon London! Can wait to look that quivering coward Logan Paul in the eyes.

Logan smart by sending the final OF bosses Corinna and Lena at me to give Nina time to breathe. 😂
On my way to pick up Corinna.
Corinna like if it’s not this couch I’m not coming.
There's plenty of room honey 🍯

Give Corinna her phone back Logan you not slick 😂

I caught up with a friend at the beach and on my way back to my car a couple had just parked their two week old Tesla Y next to me I couldn’t resist but to ask the owner his opinion about his purchase Unbeknownst to me it was only two weeks old So he was a lot more enthusiastic about his Tesla than I expected and kindly offered for me to have a look and sit in the drivers seat to get a feel of the car I was very impressed with the quality finish of the interior and the feel of the steering and comfort of the seats I have coveted the Tesla for a while now I will continue to dream about purchasing this car for a while longer Number plate removed for privacy
Dice didn’t use sunscreen
The misfortune of the mosquito was obvious 
"As I have said from day one: Desantis suffers from the Hillary Clinton personality-problem. He just isn’t personable. This issue was further compounded by his influencer network and comms team—Bizarrely, even more unlikeable than him. He’s still a great governor though."
"Great job, ! It was always inevitable. I remember when everyone laughed at me when I platformed him when he was polling at less than 1%. Not enough donors in the world to make Desantis interesting. Sorry I told you the truth. "
This is an extraordinarily embarrassing leak for the Desantis campaign. Donors writing attack lines for you to say on stage to your opponents at a debate is just…yikes. Beyond inauthentic. 
"A lot of truth to this but you’re missing a piece. There is some real creative talent on the Right. I’ve worked with some of them. But the other part of the problem is that when conservatives try to do anything creative, and especially if they have any kind of success, there will always be others on the Right who look for a reason to tear them down and insist that what they’ve done is actually somehow bad for some dumb reason or another. Conservatives are generally really bad at supporting their own creative talent. Leftists have a united front while we eat each other alive for no apparent reason. If you want conservatives to create culture then you need to find your talented culture creators and support them. Instead we get stuck in these purity spirals and nothing is ever good enough"
A lot of conservatives feel safe speaking publicly against the evils of the trans agenda but they don’t have the courage to admit that it began with homosexuality. LG laid the groundwork for BTQIA which is laying the groundwork for pedophilia.
I stand with Uganda. Don’t let the homo-agenda infiltrate your nation as it has ours. We are now battling pedophiles who are demanding access to our children and want to mutilate their private parts.
This man is about to get a title shot against Israel Adesanya. The mainstream press is about to hate Sean Strickland. 😂
"I swore off the microwave this year. Everything done stovetop now. Tastes so much better and is obviously much better for you. To be honest, the microwave doesn’t actually save you that much time. Takes maybe 3 more minutes to heat something on the stove vs. microwave."
These psychopaths will release dangerous thugs back onto the streets but they’ll send a cop to prison for merely being in the vicinity when a violent drug addict died while resisting arrest
"Not sure if any other woman has experienced this but I feel so much more aggressive when I am pregnant with a boy as opposed to a girl. 2nd boy pregnancy and both times, infinitely more aggressive… than usual. Ha."
I am so proud and happy that Ne-Yo did not back down from his stance against mutilating children. More black men (and all men) need to learn not to cower to the perverted media agenda. Apparently the apology was posted by a publicist—not him. Men need to LEAD.
"Kanye West cannot be cancelled. That fact is very mystifying and frustrating for some to understand. If politics has taught me anything, it’s that people come from something will never understand those that come from nothing. What didn’t create you, cannot destroy you."
"On NEVER TRUMP. If you were around in 2015-2016, you remember the “conservative movement” to stop Trump. They attacked him. Said he couldn’t win. After Access Hollywood, they said QUIT THE RACE. They wanted to give the country to Hillary. Trump won, now what? You can’t be a viable PERSONALITY if you opposed Trump. Listeners won’t listen or buy books. Never Trump’ers got in line. They SAW THE LIGHT. They LOVE Trump. Lmfao! It’s was obviously fake. But as usual, conservatives can be goobers and they fall for it. “People change,” audiences said. They opened their wallets up to the same people ready to cut and run over one Trump audio clip. It’s 2023 and the familiar arguments surface. Trump can’t win! We will be giving the country to Democrats! Now that Never Trump have their stalking horse in DeSantis, they are all suddenly turning on Trump. This time with more delicacy. They won’t say they hate Trump. That would be PERSONALITY suicide. It’s a tightrope. When the country was about to be destroyed, some held and line and some didn’t. They showed up after victory to claim credit or at least blend in. That’s the true story of the Never Trump movement - then and rebranded for the 2024 election."
This is honestly just sad. Probably not even her fault. We won’t know the effects of the media’s non-stop anti-white BLM propaganda campaign for years to come. History teaches us that propaganda-induced hatred is real. This woman needs help.
Ron Desantis’ most ardent supporters have quietly thrown in the towel. They aren’t even trying to sell/promote him anymore. They’ve now turned to full-time bashing every other candidate in the field. Latest iteration of the 2016 “Never Trump” movement. They just hate everyone.

"Trump is being politically persecuted today in New York by the crooked democrats because they know he is the only one that can beat Joe Biden in 2024. The RINOs, like DeSantis, who are cheering on this persecution make me sick! Only Trump 2024!"
Most boss answer ever. “I have a castle.”
"Joe Biden and the Dems got lucky when the Judge barred cameras from the courtroom. President Trump is currently dismantling this bogus case, and exposing the partisan hacks who brought it. If this was a nationally broadcast trial, President Trump would be locking up the entire election right here, and go on to become the first candidate to sweep all 50 states."
Trump unleashed is pure 🔥. Crooked Letitia James can go straight to hell.
The man in the arena
Peter Meijer is a disgrace and a moron. He was one of the ten RINOs that voted to impeach Trump and he got crushed in his congressional primary last year. Michigan Republicans will never support this fool!
"Someone woke up salty… and for the record, is an icon, Kim Reynolds is the most unpopular Governor in America."
So true ! Iowa is Trump country!
"Trump endorsed Kim Reynolds and helped get her elected How did she repay him? By endorsing his opponent, another disloyal governor who took Trump’s endorsement only to backstab him a few years later The 1 silver lining here is that we now know who’s who No more hiding"
One year from today will evict Crooked Joe from our beautiful White House!
Boring. Kim Reynolds is a wildly unpopular governor who will move the needle zero in Iowa. She has already been campaigning for DeSantis for months and desantis has nose dived in Iowa. A formal endorsement means nothing. Iowa is Trump Country! 
America wants Trump back!
🚨🚨🚨 BOMBSHELL polling shows Biden’s implosion and Trump skyrocketing in latest NYT/Siena poll. ALL ABOARD the Trump Train for 2024! 🚂🚂 
"DeSantis’ “special helper” Bryan Griffin and his sidekick, Christina “Botched” Pushaw spend all day every day attacking Trump and his supporters like online using their own accounts or their burner accounts. But when confronted in person they had nothing to say… Keyboard clowns."

"In the aftermath of Tuesday's big wins for Democrats, the GOP thinks they lost because folks were allowed to vote. Americans voted against awful anti-abortion policies the majority of voters reject. Republicans will keep losing if they keep trying to control women's bodies."
I remain baffled that seditious Ginni Thomas still has yet to be subpoenaed. What's that all about?
"NEWS: trump just said he'd consider Tucker Carlson as his running mate if (when) he gets the nomination. Is he serious, or is he desperate? And would that worry you?"
Katy Tur is up there right now begging Symone Sanders to say that Democrats don't really want President Biden to run for reelection. She is the awful Andrea Mitchell-in-training. So sick of her bullshit.
"🚨MORE EXCELLENT NEWS: In a night full of MAGA losses, perhaps no other group suffered more losses than Moms for Liberty, the controversial pro-Trump group, which faced resounding defeats in five out of the six states where their candidates contested. They were absolutely clobbered in Pennsylvania, where all five of their candidates, running on a platform of banning educational books related to slavery and LGBTQ+ inclusion, were decisively beaten by Democratic contenders. Virginia witnessed an even more significant defeat, with three Moms for Liberty school board candidates losing by substantial margins. Iowa saw a staggering nine Moms for Liberty candidates losing their races after accusing local school districts of ""disseminating pornography to children"" for featuring books discussing LGBTQ+ acceptance. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, all four Moms for Liberty candidates were overwhelmed by their Democratic opponents. North Carolina also experienced a setback as their sole candidate suffered a decisive defeat. These results highlight the voters' rejection of Moms for Liberty values and raise questions about the popularity of their positions, particularly those related to educational materials and LGBTQ+ issues. And it's even more likely that voters are starting to signal their fatigue with Trump-aligned candidates."
Andrea Mitchell is the worst. MSNBC needs to move on. Change my mind.
"THANK YOU to the Grassroots VIPs — our Volunteers In Politics from SF to OH to VA — who helped Democrats deliver Democracy on Election Day 2023! Months of phone and text banks, door knocks, picket lines and coalition work helped make the difference. When we VOTE, we WIN! -NP"
"While I'll admit it is super fun to spike the damn football (and I will be doing it some more today), we can't rest on this victory; we have to BUILD on it. Let's use the momentum from these wins to propel us into 2024 with enthusiasm about all the things DEMs do for America."

These are not insignificant wins. These are HUGE wins, with major ramifications for next year. Republicans have delivered the worst possible issue to defend against, and we'll ride it to victory with all of the legislative successes of the Democratic party in 2024.

Casey DeSantis used teleprompters during her intro screech of Rob DeSantis. The first thing Rob did when he got on stage was attack her for using teleprompters. Who attacks their own wife like that?! So strange!!!
DeSantis just attacked his wife for using teleprompters during her speech. What a bizarre little man.
DeSantis “influencers” are already beginning to boost RFK Jr against Trump. They will kick it into the next gear once DeSantis drops out.
"Did you know that there is already a plan set for DeSantis “influencers” to become RFK Jr boosters once DeSantis drops out?

REMEMBER that when you vote. VOTE BLUE."
"Karma comes to collect: Rudy Giuliani's financial woes continue to mount, as reports now suggest that the disgraced former ""America's Mayor"" faces the possible foreclosure of his Palm Beach condo due to unpaid taxes. The Palm Beach Post has disclosed that Giuliani's failure to meet property tax obligations could lead to the loss of his beachfront residence. The outstanding tax debt exceeds $84,000, and a firm has already secured the tax sale certificates, paving the way for a potential foreclosure in the spring of 2024. Giuliani's financial struggles are further exacerbated by mounting legal fees stemming from various lawsuits and indictments related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Some of his attorneys have already resigned due to non-payment. This property tax predicament is just one of Giuliani's ongoing financial issues. He also grapples with $500,000 in unpaid federal taxes, as reported by Forbes. The IRS has additionally placed a lien on his Palm Beach condo. Giuliani faces a $236,000 debt in a defamation case following his fabrication of a story about election workers in Georgia. It's noteworthy that many of his issues are due to his support of Trump, who has ironically declined to cover Giuliani's legal fees."

"NEW: Jack Smith just filed court documents that could be damning to Trump's claims about January 6th Responding to a motion filed by former President Trump's legal team, federal prosecutors on Monday argued allegations related to the events at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 are 'relevant and probative' in the Washington, DC case against the former president. The Prosecutors allege that Trump ‘Is Responsible for the Events at the Capitol on January 6’ Trump is charged with four federal felonies in the case alleging he obstructed the 2020 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Trump's legal team had argued in their motion that because none of the four felony counts in the case directly charge the former president with responsibility for the actions at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, ""allegations related to these actions are not relevant and are prejudicial and inflammatory"" and should be stricken from the indictment. In their response filed on Monday, prosecutors countered by arguing that Trump is, in fact, responsible for those events. His trial is scheduled to begin on March 4."

"Let's talk about trump's LONG string of broken promises. He promised to build a wall. He only did 458 miles out of 2,000. Much of it was replacement, not new. He promised to make Mexico pay. They didn't. He promised to cut the deficit. He added $8T to it. He promised to unveil a new health care plan. It didn't exist. He promised a middle class tax cut. He cut taxes for the rich. The middle class is paying for it. He said COVID would just go away like magic. Hocus Pocus: it didn't. He said he wouldn't play golf as President. He made 250 visit to his own golf clubs. It cost taxpayers $136 million. He said he'd increase economic growth by 4%. He didn't. President Biden did. And trump is the first President to LOSE millions of jobs since Herbert Hoover. He promised an infrastructure plan. He had none. President Biden signed a massive one. He promised to hire ""the best people."" He fired half of them, and then said they were the worst ever. He promised to bring down the price of prescription drugs. He didn't: President Biden did. He promised to drain the swamp. He didn't: He WAS the swamp. He promised to make America Great Again. He didn't. If he did, it'd still be great. But he's campaigning on the same thing. This was only a partial list of broken promises. trump is saying all over again that he'll do all of the things he promised to do but never did because he was too busy with petty beefs and breaking the law. Enough with the broken promises. President Biden and Democrats DELIVER."

The lawyer then asks if Trump can see that it says ""in order to induce lending,"" and Trump again says ""yes."" Attorney General's lawyer: ""Little Roman i, it says as of June 30, 2011.

"Sometimes, acts of kindness from strangers can save lives. Even a 16-year-old stranger. 💙 A compassionate young man spotted a stranger sitting on a bridge ledge in Dublin, Ireland, engaged in a 45-minute conversation, and saved his life. 🙏 ""I was just on my way to the American sweet shop to buy some Gatorade, when I saw this guy in his 30s sitting on the ledge of the bridge. I just thought, ""wow..."" I stopped and asked him if he was okay, but I knew from the look in his eyes he wasn't, and he didn't say anything either, but I saw tears coming from his eyes. I pleaded with him for a while to come down and sit on the steps, and eventually he did. We sat on the sidewalk on the south side of the Liffey and talked for about 45 minutes, about what was happening to him, why was he feeling that way... I couldn't leave him there alone, but I had to go, so I was going to ring an ambulance. I told him they could help him feel better. But he was like ""please, please don't call them, I'm fine, I just want to walk around for a while, I'm gonna be okay!"" I told him to please let me ring an ambulance, that I wouldn't sleep knowing he was just walking around alone. So I rang it, and he was taken to St. James Hospital. I got his number so I would know what was going on with him for a good while... And about three months ago, he texted me that his wife is pregnant, they're having a boy, and they're naming him after me. Can you believe that? They're going to name their child after me... He said in that moment that I approached him, he was just about to jump, and those few words saved his life. That they're still ringing in his head every day. ""Are you okay?"" I can't really understand how these few words could save his life, but he told me, ""Imagine if nobody ever asked you those words..."" "" Credit: Jamie Harrington"

"🚨🚨BREAKING: Disgraced former President Donald Trump is turning in a disgraceful performance during his testimony in a New York courtroom today, now having been admonished numerous times by Judge Engoron for not answering questions. Trump has been refusing to answer direct questions from the prosecution, choosing instead to lash out at the judge, the prosecution, and the Democratic party, painting himself as a victim of political targeting. At one point, Trump complained about Engoron, saying, ""I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me."" But the judge is not entertaining Trump's overly-dramatic answers. He reportedly told Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, ""Mr. Kise - can you control your client? This is not a political rally . . . maybe you should have a talk with him right now."" It should be noted that Judge Engoron has already ruled Trump is liable for fraud, and these proceedings are merely to determine how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages."
"Donald trump is refusing to answer direct questions in court now, instead choosing to speechify about how he believes he's being targeted. None of that is going to help him with the verdict. He's going to LOSE the trial and all of his trump Org assets. ALL OF IT."
"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who is ignoring the polls a full year away from the 2024 election and is determined to cast their vote to reelect President Biden no matter what. I'll be voting straight Blue ticket all the way, because I know what's at stake. 🙏💪💙"
"I've seen creepy stuff before, but all the way near the top of the list is Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson putting software on his son's devices, and his own, so they can be ""accountability partners"" and monitor each other's online porn habits. Ewww."
"Whomever made this, bravo!"
"Let's talk about WHY House Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson's idea to release 40,000 hours of House CCTV from January 6th ONLY to ultra-right wing ""news"" outlet The Blaze is such a horrendously horrible idea. First, let's establish what has ALREADY transpired: All of us watched and experienced, in real time, footage from the events of January 6th, as they unfolded. This includes dozens of trump's high-level supporters, people ""on the inside"" who frantically tried to reach Mark Meadows ON THAT DAY, begging him to put out a statement to stop his supporters from rioting. From Laura Ingraham to Mark Meadows: Hey Mark, The president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us He is destroying his legacy and playing into every stereotype … we lose all credibility against the BLM/Antifa crowd if things go South Rep. Barry Loudermilk to Mark Meadows It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol. We are under siege in the capitol Donald Trump Jr. to Mark Meadows He’s got to condemn this shit. Asap. The capitol police tweet is not enough. This his one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse. Why did people, including his own unhinged son, panic upon seeing the same things we did? Does that sound like a normal, peaceful tour to anyone? Not at all. They were rightfully sickened and fearful by the violent images we saw, that Tucker Carlson would later try to gaslight us into thinking we didn't actually see. In fact, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy even admitted trump's culpability in the dangerous fiasco, saying on the House floor. “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding."" He said this, of course, before releasing tons of footage to Tucker Carlson, and ONLY Tucker. TUCKER CARLSON'S SELECTIVE EDITING Weakest Speaker in the history of House, McCarthy agreed to release 41,000 hours of January 6th footage to far-right wing promoter of “Great Replacement” theory Tucker Carlson. Out of 41,000 hours of footage that would have included video of January 6th Capitol attackers smearing the walls with feces and smashing Capitol Police officers with fire extinguishers, Carlson cherry-picked a few out-of-context videos showing calm images of people being led through the Capitol, pushing the narrative that ""nothing happened."" Sure, you could edit footage of the Diamondbacks scoring runs and show the Texas Rangers' hitters striking out to make it look like Arizona won the whole thing, but everyone who watched (and laughed and cried) would know it was false. WHO IS MAGA MIKE JOHNSON? Mike Johnson played a key role in the efforts by trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Specifically, he led the amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit trying to invalidate the 2020 election results in four swing states Biden won: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. So naturally, anything that would potentially tell a different story of January 6th, rather than the one correctly painting him as a leading member of the Sedition Caucus, is welcomed by the new House Speaker. WHAT IS The Blaze? The Blaze is an ultra right wing conservative ""news"" outlet, founded by Glenn Beck. Beck, who believes that ""shadowy elites have taken over the country,"" also believes that Tucker Carlson's selectively-edited clips from January 6th are proof that the January 6th committee lied about the events of that day. So would it surprise anyone if the footage selected from that day helps to support Beck's belief? I wouldn't be surprised at all. SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? So OK, let's play devil's advocate for a moment and ask the question ""What's the big deal? Who cares if The Blaze tries to paint a picture that the Diamondbacks actually WON the World Series, and that January 6th was a calm, ordinary tour of the Capitol? Who even watches or reads The Blaze anyway?"" Plenty of people. And since it is now guaranteed to be given favorable treatment under Twitter's new pro-right algorithm, the views of the cherry-picked footage will go through the roof, and then be picked up by Fox and Newsmax which, unfortunately, ARE watched by millions. As a nation, we're still struggling to get back to a junction where we can all collectively agree that 2+2 DOES equal 4, and it's not a plot by elite coastal libs to make it seem that way. And dumping thousands of hours of footage onto ONE SIDE are not helpful. I will admit that, throughout the many hours of footage, there are probably pockets of video that show people calmly walking from one section of the building to another. No argument there. And I will also admit that, in every crowd of rampaging angry rioters, that there are handfuls of people just milling about, taking pictures, not hurting anyone. But that makes them the exception to the rule, it doesn't characterize the entire mob that way. Release the footage to Reuters and Associated Press, which are generally seen as closer to the middle. Release the footage publicly, to everyone, and let us draw our own conclusions. But to first slide it over to Tucker Carlson, and now to The Blaze, makes it painfully obvious that these complicit MAGA House Speakers are trying to craft a bullshit narrative to cover their own asses. And it needs to be called out. LOUDLY."

"If you're disgusted by how the GOP bends over backwards to ensure that their oil & gas overlords get their big profits at our expense, I suggest you follow us at so you don't miss an opportunity to raise your voice in disgust with us as we focus on 2024."
"Good morning and Happy Sunday to everyone who finds it obscene that Exxon posted their Q3 profits at $19,660,000,000 -- the highest ever in their 152-year existence. The GOP blamed President Biden for high gas prices while voting AGAINST the Oil & Gas price gouging bill."
"Rep. Zinke's bill proposing a ban on Palestinians entering the U.S. is an appalling attack on human rights, and a disgraceful affront to the principles of compassion proudly etched on our Statue of Liberty. 2024: Vote these hateful f*ckers OUT of Congress."
"Appreciation post for President Barack Obama, whom we elected 15 years ago and who raised the bar for presidential excellence. Compassionate, charismatic, highly intelligent and consequential, we were lucky to have him as President. ❤️🇺🇲💙"

"Good morning and Happy Saturday to everyone who agrees with Liz Cheney that Christian Fundamentalist Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson ""is a dangerous person to lead the House."" He's anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and an anti-democracy trump thug who tried to overturn the 2020 election."

"🚨NEWS: New York Judge Arthur Engoron has expanded the gag order against disgraced former President Trump, now encompassing his legal team. This decision followed a massive influx of hundreds of threats of violence received by the court due to Trump's attacks on Engoron, state prosecutors, and the court clerk. Trump has been fined $15,000 for violating the gag order twice, with both instances involving the judge's clerk, whom the former president labeled as ""partisan."" On the second occasion, Trump attempted to assert that his remarks were aimed at his former attorney, Michael Cohen, who was a witness in the trial. Engoron dismissed this explanation. In response to another comment made by Trump's attorney, Christopher Keiss, Engoron hinted at the possibility of extending the ban to cover attorneys. It is disgraceful that a former President lacks the impulse control to refrain from threatening citizens and members of the court, and lacks the ability to prevent his lawyers from doing the same. At some point, jail time might be necessary to send Trump and his legal team a clear message."

"🚨This story is AMAZING. Real heroes don't wear capes: Sometimes they wear webs. A real-life hero is making a difference on the streets of Birmingham. Disguised as Spider-Man, this 20-year-old, who prefers to remain anonymous, purchases food and sandwiches from stores to distribute to the homeless in his community. ""I've worked with homeless and vulnerable people for three or four years and love seeing the smiles on people's faces,"" he explained. ""Then I thought, 'if they are happy now, imagine how much bigger the smile would be if it was Spider-Man giving out the food.'"" Several nights a week, between 9 pm and midnight, he dons his superhero costume and seeks out those who are hungry, cold, and sleeping rough. ""I've learned that everyone is the same; we're all part of the human experience, and I believe that we need to look at everyone as humans and help each other the same as we would a close friend,"" said the compassionate Spider-Man. His actions not only bring joy to the homeless but also aim to inspire others to become heroes for those in need. ""Before, when I was handing out food, no one would take a second look,"" he noted. ""But when they see Spider-Man handing out the food, they come over and ask what I'm doing and are really interested. Most importantly, they become inspired to get involved themselves."" News of the Spider-Man of Birmingham spread globally, prompting people to fundraise and donate to his cause. But he declines their donations and instead encourages them to go out into their own communities and assist the less fortunate. ""People have seen me on Facebook or Twitter, and they say what I am doing is really good. Some are even saying they want to do the same. I plan to do it for as long as I can."" He is also dedicated to raising awareness about homelessness and educating others on the importance of helping one another."

"Oh this is hilarious: If you're in a courtroom as an attorney, and you mention Breitbart dot com as a credible source of information, you might want to consider trading in your law degree for a comedian's microphone. Donald Trump's attorney expressed concerns about a mistrial in the $250 million fraud case, citing the right-wing media website's accusation of bias against a New York City law clerk. Chris Kise referenced a Breitbart report as the source of his concern, and the courtroom burst into laughter. ""I think the defense will have to give serious consideration to seeking a mistrial,"" Kise stated during the Friday morning proceedings, as reported by ABC News. In response, Judge Engoron characterized the report as an ""allegation"" rather than substantive information, emphasizing that it pertained to a ""random individual"" with ""accusations of partisan political activity."" An attorney from Attorney General Letitia James's office questioned the seriousness of Kise's claims, particularly since he couldn't immediately recall the website responsible for the report. Kise defended himself, saying, ""I'm not the internet person. I want to say it is on Breitbart, maybe? It's on a news outlet."" This reference to Breitbart triggered laughter from onlookers, as reported by ABC News."

"Republicans are so comfortable with voter suppression, they openly brag about it. Like Texas AG Ken Paxton bragged on Steve Bannon's podcast about blocking 2.5 million mail-in ballots from being counted, preventing Biden from winning Texas. My takeaway: TEXAS IS WINNABLE."

"🚨🚨GOP IN DISARRAY, Space Laser Edition: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is locked in yet another heated exchange with fellow Republican Lauren Boebert, ripping her for her notorious Beetlejuice sexual misconduct scandal. The clash began when Greene faced resistance from some within the Republican caucus over her motion to censure Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, which was criticized by Republican Representative Chip Roy. He described Greene's resolution as ""flawed"" and filled with ""unverified claims,"" including allegations of leading an 'insurrection.' This criticism triggered a fiery response from Greene, who took to Twitter to air her frustration. She accused her fellow Republicans of retaining figures like Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert, whom she referred to as a ""vaping groper,"" while voting with Democrats to protect Representative Tlaib. Greene also accused them of disliking former President Trump, acknowledging President Biden's election, and showing indifference towards the prosecution of January 6 defendants. Rep. Roy lashed back, ridiculing Greene's conspiracy theories, suggesting that she should chase after ""Jewish space lasers"" if she wanted to focus on such matters. Greene shot back, calling him ""Colonel Sanders"" and insinuating that he had little to do with Texas, and slamming him as a career politician. A short while ago, Greene ironically called for ""decorum"" in the House, even though she is known for being disruptive and inappropriate. Her inflammatory insults directed at Boebert were written on her official government account. Once again, while the country faces unique challenges, Republicans are focused on petty matters instead of legislating for Americans."

She also accused Roy of voting to kick her out of the Freedom Caucus but allowing “vaping groping” Rep. Lauren Boebert” to stay. What are your thoughts? Do you think this Republican majority is wasting tax payer time and money with petty infighting? What are they doing for America?"

"But who is this American woman? How did she meet the Tate brothers? Who are the 3 other alleged victims named in Andrew’s case and what do they have to say about it? If you do not know these answers and yet have assisted the media in its character assassination of the Tate brothers since their arrest, then you are abetting a trial by media rather than a trial by fact."
"Given the noise of social media, many are unaware, but Andrew and Tristan Tate’s current case in Romania began after a young American woman from the Palm Beach area booked herself a business class, one-way ticket to Romania using Tristan’s credit card. Just six days later (and despite her pleas for the efforts to be reversed) the United States embassy was contacted and Romanian authorities swooped in to rescue her from an alleged human trafficking situation."
"Of course, these utterly baseless attacks against me only worked to further my interest in his case. And when I dug further, I was shocked at what I discovered…"
"Over the last week, I have faced everything from absurd libels (aiding a human trafficker and pornographer) to wild conspiracies (Tate must have paid her, or must be blackmailing her), simply for refusing to join the chorus of individuals who wish to convict on the basis of whether or not they believe him to be a good or bad person."
"In fact so deeply embedded is our presumption of guilt for men, that should any person have the gall to question an alleged victim—the media (mainstream, alternative, AND independent) then works to smear and libel that individual. Somehow, I have always had the gall."
"But objective immorality, whether past or present does not make somebody guilty of a crime. Since the era of , it has become customary for women to be immediately believed and subsequently afforded protection by the media. While men who face allegations have every area of their lives painfully examined, the women behind these allegations are not subjected to the same inspection."
"🚨🧵In a few hours, I will be dropping an explosive video regarding the case. What I will preface this with is a fact: We live in a modern society that has fostered a fundamental hatred for men and it is much easier to hate men that come from a checkered past and who have said and done things that we deem to be immoral."

Well Well Well - what have we here?
"The Ari Emanuel effort to rehabilitate M Markle is obvious -Suits is everywhere; Ppl Mag w/4 pieces on how she’s softened on royal fam (um, sure); new pr push - & will fail. This is not some blank canvas on which an agent can paint. We’ve seen who she is & firmly rejected her."
Desantis campaign headquarters: Q: How do we deal with Trump? A: Call all of his supporters stupid. Q: How do we deal with Vivek? A: Call all Trump supporters who support him stupid. That’ll work.
"I’m actually looking forward to doing a post-Mortem on Desantis’ campaign. Slogan should have been “shut up and listen, dummies”"
"Desantis campaign officially in panic mode about Vivek who they initially didn’t think would make the debate stage. Their strategy? Keep calling Trump supporters stupid— but this time, the ones that think Vivek has potential. Can’t make this stuff up."
Which is why you’re my favorite congressman and should pursue higher office.
"John Eastman, the so-called ""Co-Conspirator 2,"" just made a GREAT point on our program: The First Amendment doesn't just include a right to freedom of speech. It also includes a right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Now, Jack Smith wants to criminalize the act of contesting an election through the courts and by lobbying legislators. Every step of this indictment is a war on the Constitution."
This is a de facto pardon from DOJ. That’s why Biden said he wouldn’t give Hunter Biden a pardon. Garland already did.

"In the contest for the worst U.S. politician, Trump wins easily. Right behind him is the sedition caucus consisting of coward Josh Hawley, military obstructionist Tommy Tuberville, and a clown car full of criminal co-conspirators. The GOP does not have the decency to lead."
"The prospect of a 2nd Trump term and a Republican sweep of Congress is VERY real Another Trump win would sound the death knell for our democracy We must work shoulder to shoulder to prevent this As Wisconsin goes, so goes the nation Help us sound the alarm now 🚨"
"Heartbreaking: Lindsey Graham, one of the worst Senators you know, just made a great point about Tommy Tuberville. "
"JUST IN: The Republican party is still predictably crooked, failing to expel their very worst sitting Congressman, Rep. George Santos. The vote was 213 to 179, with 19 voting present. Use it against them in 2024, folks."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: The House is expected to vote on whether to expel Rep. George Santos sometime after 6:30 pm ET tonight, as per Democratic whip Katherine Clark’s office. To make matters even worse for Santos, five House Republican lawmakers from New York have sent a letter, strongly imploring that he be expelled. “As Republican Members from the New York Delegation, we fully support Santos’ expulsion, and ask all of our colleagues to join us in voting yes,” the letter begins, which was signed by GOP members Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Anthony D’Esposito, Marcus Molinaro and Brandon Williams. The letter even dismisses Republican concerns that Santos' expulsion could put their slim House majority in jeopardy. ""The United States Congress must always uphold the highest standards and ensure accountability for those who have taken advantage of the American people – regardless of political party.” The ethics committee has also announced it will provide an update about its investigation into Santos by November 17th, while some House members are concerned that removing him from his seat before he is convicted will set a bad precedent."
"HOLY SH*T: As just reported by Ali Vitale on MSNBC, a small group of Republican Senators are ready to cross the aisle to vote with DEMOCRATS to break Tommy Tuberville's stupid military blockade. WOW!"
"On second thought... The cop was holding up 3 fingers in the video, which yeah, it could have meant 3 percenter, but it could have meant something entirely different. And I couldn't say with 100% certainty. So I took it down. In case this cop was innocently telling them to go to room 300, or signaling that 3 people were entering, I'd rather not be instrumental in causing a guy to lose his job and his ability to support his family. I saw something that looked questionable, and I reacted to it without thinking, and that was wrong. I try my hardest NOT to contribute to the stream of misinformation on this site, and when I catch myself I'll be sure to delete and let you folks know. Thanks for riding with me.🙏💪"
LESS THAN 150 HOURS UNTIL THE VIRGINIA POLLS CLOSE — YOU can make the difference! Extreme Republicans are plotting a draconian abortion ban — you can stop them! -NP Volunteer:

"PATRIOTS! Can we get 1,000 quick replies usin’ the hashtag to help make it the top trend about our preventin' that vest wearin' Governor Youngkin from passin' a 15-week abortion ban?"
"TWEEPS: Next Tuesday, we can send a message to Republicans across America that their anti-Woman agenda is DOOMED for defeat by getting out the Vote for a CRITICAL election. IF WE SHOW UP, WE WIN. Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag to get it trending on Twitter? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"This is an AMAZING story💙: a successful Canadian entrepreneur is building 99 tiny homes to cut homelessness in his community – he even provides jobs for them on site! Marcel LeBrun, the founder of 12 Neighbors, sold his thriving social media monitoring company for eight figures to a U.S. competitor. He has now committed his substantial profit to addressing homelessness in Fredericton, New Brunswick. 12 Neighbors, located in Fredericton, is a community development initiative focused on creating a gated community of 99 tiny homes and an enterprise center, providing homeless individuals in Fredericton with a chance for a fresh start. The project is designed to support those in need by offering shelter, employment, and a sense of belonging. LeBrun has invested $4 million of his own money into the project, which is already three-quarters complete. In addition to his personal investment, 12 Neighbors has received support from provincial and national governments, totaling $12 million. The tiny homes are fully equipped, featuring a complete kitchen, living and sleeping areas, and a full bathroom. Each home is equipped with solar panels on the roof and decorated with an aesthetically pleasing coat of paint. LeBrun believes that tackling homelessness can be more straightforward than perceived, and providing a tiny home can be a pivotal step in the right direction. “I see myself as a community builder, and really what we’re doing here is not just building a little community, but we’re building a community in a city, like how do we help our city be better?” LeBrun said. The community also includes an enterprise center, which will feature a resident-run coffee bar, a ""teaching kitchen,"" and a silk-screening business. These elements are intended to make 12 Neighbors a place where the wider Fredericton community can visit for coffee or take advantage of affordable printing services. Marcel LeBrun's project exemplifies the transformative impact that wealth, creativity, and compassion can have on the lives of those experiencing homelessness."
"If the New Yorkers in Santos' district had known about the outrageous mountain of lies Santos told, they would not have voted for him. In fact, 78% of his constituents said in a poll that he should resign, including 89% of Democrats, 72% of independents and 71% of Republicans."
"If you're hopeful that the House of Representatives will soon return to some semblance of normalcy by at least removing its most egregiously deceitful member, the I suggest you follow us at , where we believe voters have a right to know who they are electing."
"JUST IN: Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy, and torpedoed both Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan's Speaker hopes, just announced that he will NOT seek reelection at the end of his term. It's the second such announcement from Republican members of Congress today. I hope it's a trend."
"Josh Hawley is making a solid argument here for his own removal, as well as other lying Republicans: ""When you systematically mislead the American people and lie and lie and lie to the American people. You're not doing your job and you should be removed."
"BREAKING: According to reports, $2.99/gallon is the most commonly seen gas price in the United States. Reports also indicate that 38,000 stations, or 25% of the entire nation's gas stations have a price of $2.99/gallon price or better. This is a big deal."
BREAKING: The vote to expel George Santos from Congress could happen as soon as TODAY. Who else supports his expulsion?✋
"Boy, I tell you: if the fate of MY financial empire rested on the testimony of slack-brained Don Jr. and Eric trump, LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO"

"In this Trump indictment, Democrats are punishing Trump for trying to investigate and call out their wrongdoing in the 2020 election. It’s the same MO as the first Trump impeachment where Trump was punished for trying to investigate and call out Biden’s wrongdoing in Ukraine. In both cases the Trump attacks serve to cover up the wrongdoing of Biden/Dems."

Unfortunate that the countrymen of Canada can’t be afforded the same option.

THIS Is The Reason I Interviewed Andrew Tate
"It’s been more than 4 months since a trans psychopath shot & killed 6 innocent people at Covenant High School in Nashville. 4 months and still no answers. The FBI & local police committed to releasing the shooter’s written manifesto, but now they’re quietly reneging and trying to sweep this under the rug. We won’t let them. If we don’t own up to it, we’re destined to suffer even worse in the future. On Wednesday at 1 PM CT I will host a press conference at the Davidson County Courthouse to call for the release of the manifesto. Will be joined by & other local community leaders in Nashville."
I just say what’s on everyone’s minds.
2.3 million views in 2 days on YouTube alone (and climbing). Find out why. 
Men: you are called upon to build and to lead. You are not called upon to gossip on the internet.
I think they must genuinely wonder why they never get a response from me and it’s simply because their behavior is gay.
I’ve got a group of about 5 men that obsessively mean-tweet me all day. I cannot state enough how effeminate this behavior is. Men should never ever EVER engage with social media in this way. Leave the catty tweets and obsessive behavior to women.
Save your outrage. You’re going to need to it for when you find out who I’ve got lined up to interview next.
"I don’t know who needs to hear this but— we are living under a matriarchy, not a patriarchy. And it’s hellish."
Jordan Peterson also topping the list for mentions— I should add. Also hated by the mainstream media.
"Follow up question for men only: When it comes to your idea of traditional masculinity, who are some men that you think proudly embody it in the public sphere?"
"Thus far, these seem to be the most often repeated names of who men follow. Virtually all of these men (barring PBD) are absolutely detested by the mainstream media. Fascinating."

OG FORTNITE MAP IS COMING BACK??!?
"Follow the MAGA Mike Money: New GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson began his tenure in a swirl of controversy about his positions on abortion and same sex marriage, but a bizarre new fact has come to light: he does not appear to have a bank account in his name. This should be a MUCH bigger story. According to a report from The Daily Beast's Roger Sollenberger, ""Over the course of seven years, Johnson has never reported a checking or savings account in his name, nor in the name of his wife or any of his children, disclosures show. In fact, he doesn’t appear to have money stashed in any investments, with his latest filing — covering 2022 — showing no assets whatsoever."" Reporting guidelines for the House Ethics Committee mandate the disclosure of any bank accounts that have at least $1,000 with the combination of ALL accounts, including family members and children, exceeding $5,000. The absence of a bank account, while Johnson draws a $174,000 annual salary plus an additional $30,000 from teaching, is extremely suspicious. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) communications director Jordan Libowitz noted “He made over $200,000 last year, and his wife took home salary from two employers as well, so why isn’t there a bank account or any form of savings listed?” Libowitz added that if Johnson's lack of a bank account is an accurate reflection of his financial situation, it leaves him susceptible to possible financial corruption or manipulation."
That’s why Mike Johnson didn’t want the CBO to score it

"🚨🚨NEWS: A prominent Senate Democrat has leveled a serious accusation against Senator Tommy Tuberville, alleging his actions may have contributed to General Eric Smith's recent cardiac emergency. Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed blames Tuberville for blocking military promotions to pressure the Pentagon into changing abortion policies, leading to overworked military officers. Tuberville's political maneuver has compelled officers to handle multiple roles, pushing some to exhaustion. General Smith's hospitalization, likely due to overwork, has been characterized as an apparent heart attack and is a stark example of the consequences. Senator Reed highlighted the dangers of Tuberville's anti-abortion tactics, emphasizing the need for a more rational approach. This situation raises concerns about Tuberville prioritizing far-right religious voters over national security, potentially jeopardizing the military to gain favor with religious interest groups. The fallout from his actions should have severe consequences for his political career as it adversely impacts the military's operational efficiency."
"DID YOU KNOW... That Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin illegally purged thousands of qualified voters from the voter rolls very close to an election?

DO IT."
"🚨MAGA Mike Johnson's religious litmus tests: Fresh perspective into the beliefs of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) are coming to the surface, shedding light on how his fundamentalist Christian values may impact his political actions. According to a recent report by David Corn, DC bureau chief of Mother Jones, Johnson and his wife, Kelly, once conducted seminars promoting the unfounded idea of the United States being a ""Christian nation."" These seminars, ranging from two-hour lectures to multi-day retreats, encouraged participants to assess the suitability of public office candidates based on their willingness to merge religion and politics. In a video from 2019, Kelly Johnson purportedly conveyed that ""biblical Christianity,"" involving a literal interpretation of the Bible, including the belief that the Earth is merely 6,000 years old, was the sole valid worldview. Mike Johnson was quoted in the same video stating, ""You better sit down any candidate who says they're going to run for the legislature and say, 'I want to know what your worldview is. I want to know what you think about the Christian heritage of this country. I want to know what you think about God’s design for society. Have you even thought about that?' If they haven’t thought about it, you need to move on and find somebody who has."" Commenting on the video, David Corn highlighted that while Mike Johnson recommended anyone interested in his beliefs to ""go pick up a Bible,"" his suggestion to subject public officials to a religious litmus test implied his support for a form of ""theocracy."" These stated beliefs are hard-baked into Johnson, and won't be discarded just because he has a position of high authority. There is a very real growing concern that his ""Christian"" beliefs could be used to disenfranchise those who do not share his faith."

"🚨CONGRESSMAN HARRY DUNN? Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, having already defended our Capitol against January 6th insurrectionists, may be looking to serve the American people from the inside of the House chamber. Dunn is eyeing a possible run for the House of Representatives. When it was announced that Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) was not going to be running for a 10th term, Dunn shared a news article about it on social media and commented ""I see there is going to be an open Congressional seat in Maryland."" Reporters from Axios confirmed that Dunn's message meant he was considering a run for the seat. Dunn wrote an editorial in Time magazine in which he noted the America we live in is ""the one we built by voting, by protesting, by agitating, by demanding, by being arrested, by getting into “some good trouble, necessary trouble.” How does the news that Officer Dunn might run for Congress make you feel?"

"🚨🚨🚨 I will be voting NO on all funding packages for the Ukraine war (as I have from the beginning) and now the Israel war. We have had over 10 MILLION people illegally cross our border since Biden took office and we are over $33 TRILLION dollars in debt with many major problems afflicting Americans. The United States government needs to focus on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars on our own country and needs to serve the American people NOT the rest of the world. I voted YES on both resolutions condemning the attack on Ukraine and the attack on Israel however I will continue to vote NO on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars to fund wars defending foreign country’s borders while our own border is overrun and our own national security is at risk. Also Ukraine and Israel are very different. Ukraine is completely propped up by the US and continues to beg for more US tax dollars while Washington fights it’s proxy war with Russia and Israel is a strong thriving independent nation that prides itself on defending their own people. Also, there is $3.8 billion dollars readily available to Israel in the Defense approps bill and the State and Foreign Ops bill, but Schumer and the Senate have not lifted a finger to pass those bills and Biden has not signed them into law. Our Republican House majority and new Speaker Johnson should refuse any more funding bills until the Senate does it’s job and our border is secure. We’ve done our job in the House and we must keep passing our remaining Approps bills. The Democrat controlled Senate has passed ZERO percent of the budget, while the House has passed over 70% of the budget. I’m tired of the games. I’m tired of the lies. I’m sick and tired and fed up with America LAST!!!"
Rob Desantis got bullied out of wearing his black heels. He’s now onto light brown with a slightly shorter heel.
"For four straight years I kept America safe, I kept Israel safe, and I kept the world safe. Today the world is blowing up all around, no matter where you look. If I were President, the attack on Israel would never, ever have happened."" - President Trump"

"There are a lot of solutions to the housing crisis people seem to not want to talk about. Vacancy taxes. Section 8 enforcement. More housing vouchers. Rent hike caps. Rent control. The only solution to homelessness is affordable, permanent housing."
Scammer deleted all of my draft tweets. Really low blow.
"the NYPD is on pace to blow past its allotted overtime budget for FY2023 by ~$366 million which is 16X what it would cost to keep public libraries open on the weekends. Keep in mind, $366 million isn’t their OT budget, it’s what the NYPD went OVER their allotted OT budget ($374M)"
"I showed this video to an ex boyfriend once and he said, that’s not funny. Put yourself in jimmy’s shoes."
That scammer wishes he was me so bad . Get a boob job babe !
Ultimately being off of twitter for five days was healing. I missed a whole discourse cycle. There were entire cultural conversations that just passed me completely.
Also this happened like 20 minutes after they took my verification badge and turned the 2FA off sooooo. Use an authenticator app! Also d*ath to the guy who tried to hold this account hostage for $300!

I’m going live about these developments. 
The story has just fallen a part gloriously. This is 10x worse than Jussie Smollet. Absolutely wild to google the movie “Taken” and “can I pay for an amber alert?” hours before you abduct yourself. I AM DONE. 😂😂😂😂
"Anytime I see the word “lynching” in the media, it’s a guaranteed hoax. Every. Single. Time."
"Columbia Tennessee is a wonderful small town that I spend time in. The building is iconic. They have filmed many movies in that square, including the Hannah Montana movie where Hannah walks outside of that courthouse. Jason and his wife are wonderful people."
Lmfao. They literally filmed the Hannah Montana movie in front of this courthouse. You guys really try so hard to racialize things that have absolutely nothing to do with race 😂 Maybe Hannah Montana was about a lynching? 😂😂😂
Sound of Freedom just hit $100M at the Box Office “Try That In A Small Town” is the song on iTunes Disney lost $900M+ on their last 8 releases and Disney World is empty Bud Light and Target lost billions of dollars over anti-woke boycotts The silent majority is real
"Tired of people telling black people what is & what isn’t racist.. racism doesn’t exist, it’s just hatred of a particular person(s).. now since you’re proud of your work, how about getting all of this degrading, violent rap/hiphop off the airwaves. Thanks in advance"
Lol. You will notice that it’s never black people and always white liberals who think they can dictate what is and is not racism in America today. They think they have the authority to be offended for us. This non-issue was entirely concocted by limousine white liberals.
"Jason Aldean's ""Try That In A Small Town"" has reached on US iTunes."
BREAKING: CMT just CANCELLED this music video by Jason Aldean about the Antifa-BLM riots You know what to do
".: ""...gay pride has become almost synonymous with sexuality... If I said, 'let's have a heterosexual pride parade,' people would probably show up with their families and their kids. No one's going to say, 'let's wear leather...and walk like dogs...' Why is that?"
The AUDACITY to make this is about race when it’s about the fact that she told a story about a toddler that could still be in harm’s way. was not the only victim included in her little tale and her alleged kidnapper has NOT been caught or even described to the public.
"I said this on my podcast today. Was the food left behind in her abandoned car? Lots of questions, zero answers."
"It is often the case that people on both sides of the aisle conflate their personal feelings about an individual with a determination as to whether or not a person “deserves” to be handed a certain sentence, or have their freedoms restricted—(see: liberals and Trump) But this is a nonsense. Whether or not you think Tucker asked Andrew Tate the right questions, Tucker’s interest in the subject matter of corrupt governments colluding to take down individuals has remained consistent throughout his career. In essence, it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is possible to think that pornography in all its forms is wrong and not a marker of conservatism, while also believing that a person who ran a web cam business should not be targeted by governments."
I’ve seen a lot of conservatives stating that Andrew Tate is not an example of conservative beliefs but I have not seen evidence of any person having made that claim. Are we building a straw man? I remain interested in what looks to be a politically-motivated case in Romania.
LOL. There’s an abductor out there but the parents cannot even disclose whether that individual is a male or female and the police refuse to issue any public warnings about the abductor. Also— zero mention of the toddler. Robin Roberts /Jussie Smollet interview 2.0. 
"Major cities far superior to build up your skills, negotiate w sociopaths, compete @ high levels in anything Go to any mountain town and look how homely, sickly, gangly everyone looks Attack in the cities, respite in the mountains. Not othe way round"

"Biggest takeaway from space - if you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Everyone thinks they got it until they get burdened with responsibility. Most will fold under dire circumstances"
 the spaces you host are incredible. Please consider writing a book my friend. God bless
If ur only obsession is getting ur super car u will be extremely disappointed when you get there my friend. I assure you The whips and cool toys just augment ur mission. They can’t be the mission. Or you’ll drown in a fathomless pit of despair. Promise
This is why having a specific goal of getting a lambo or a house in lake como is all lame U just procure these toys recreationally as ur triumphant. They’re expected. No surprise to you. They’re fun but who gives a fuck U grow for the sake of growing
I don’t give a fuck about the results themselves. Because they will come guaranteed. I only care that I maximize my limited capacity with whatever cards I got moment by moment. Then I can sleep like a baby
You’ve either refined yourself as a blunt instrument to carry out your mission or you haven’t. Your body and mind either stand in the way of your objectives or they aid and abet it. No In between
Cause men only find peace when they know they’ve done everything they could that day and that day only Life has to be tackled a day at a time & everything is not a hyperbole. Less than 1 percent will ever understand what it means to use every resource at your disposal
"Self love, self care blah blah All nonsense after a while If you really give. Shit about yourself you’ll expose yourself to it all-the negativity & the positivity Deadlifts for your mind & psychology Avoiding negative vibes at all costs is a sure fire way to end up a pussy"
"Running away from “bad vibes” is a euphemistic way of implying you’re a pussy I welcome all bad vibes So I can crush them, make an example of them and move along Not my fault you lack the game and charisma to deal with your fellow losers"
If you have pussy ass hands & skinny forearms go get a piece of rebar and keep your shoulders down and packed in. (Shoulder can’t protrude from girdle) Try to rip that shit in half as hard as you can for reps with short breaks in between Will evolve ur hands in a month
Throwing in the towel on oly lifting. Gotta train smarter at 35. Back to farmer carrying 200lb bells up slopes in the fresh air. Bending rebar with bare hands. Swinging the sledge. Training outdoors really the best way

“Spirit is the only molecule you should worry about.” Appreciate How always has a way of putting thoughts into words that I think but haven’t been able to verbalized yet.
Portnoy did what every unsightly & short man is supposed to do Overcompensate with wealth Has a searingly hard quote too ill never forget: “I didn’t hit the lottery. I built the lottery.”
"“the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us.” -losers CANT grasp this"
"Fate is doing willingly, that which you must do"
Because it’s all about the world bringing something to you rather than you bringing something to it

"INCREDIBLE HERO WITHOUT A GUN: Much is made about a hypothetical ""good guy with a gun"" who never seems to show up, but a good guy with NO gun put himself between a mass shooter and as many as eight children to save the day. Thomas Giberti wasn't expected at Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley in Maine, but his presence proved crucial when Robert Card, the murderous gunman of the Lewiston Maine mass shooting, entered and unleashed a barrage of bullets. Despite being off-duty, Giberti displayed incredible heroism, guiding as many as eight terrified children to safety while enduring multiple gunshot wounds to his legs. Currently recovering in a central Maine hospital, Giberti's remarkable actions have earned him widespread acclaim from the global bowling community, as well as the people of Maine, his family, and friends. Samantha Juray, co-owner of the bowling alley and an eyewitness to Maine's largest modern mass shooting, witnessed Giberti's selfless bravery in the midst of the chaos. Juray recounted how Giberti, initially working in the machines area, courageously placed himself in harm's way to rescue the young bowlers gathered for youth practice that night. She estimated that Giberti saved the lives of at least eight, possibly even a dozen, youth bowlers ranging from 5 to 18 years old. Dan Delcourt, who has known Giberti for two decades as a fellow bowler and neighbor, was also present during the horrifying incident. Amid the confusion and loud bangs, Delcourt and his bowling league teammates rushed toward the fire exit. Although Delcourt didn't witness Giberti's specific actions in the chaos, he affirmed Giberti's reputation for prioritizing the safety of children. ""He’s always one to think of the kids first,"" Delcourt emphasized. ""He’s the best guy you can think of."" Thomas Giberti's heroism has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the community, demonstrating exceptional courage in the face of danger."

RESULT: General Motors reaches a deal with United Auto Workers, days after both Ford and Stellantis agreed to 25% wage increases, reinstated cost-of-living adjustments to protect workers from rising prices, and other significantly enhanced benefits.

Harry loved his teddy’s so at the beginning of February 2022 I purchased this huge teddy for him from Costco. He didn’t really know what to do with it when I brought it home so it stayed mostly in tact. He then passed on August 22nd last year from cancer. The grief from losing him was excruciating. I thought I would not get another dog but the stars aligned and Ben came into my life in December 2022 just before Christmas. Whilst he was settling into his new home he took it upon himself to go and sleep on Harry’s teddy I had kept. I managed to capture the image all those months ago of Ben sleeping on the teddy. He has never slept on it since but I treasure this image so much. Ben has filled my heart again after the loss of Harry. What I have learnt from this experience is when losing a dog there is always place for another even if you don’t feel like it in the raw moment of grief. It honestly helped me cope with the loss of Harry. I will always miss him and by no means has he been replaced. He was a unique dog with his quirky personality (he suckled on his teddy’s before falling asleep). Love my two beagle boys. Once a beagle parent always a beagle parent. 🐶 🐾🦴🤍

"Oh and if ur ever in a jam and a chick says this to you, you can bet your weight in gold she’s psycho and u just haven’t seen it yet"
Basically know the strength of your will by how you pissed you get when ur in a jam & some idiot says “everything happens for a reason” Like ur some feather in the wind who can’t do jack shit about ur circumstances That advice is existentially void and horrific
Glad u asked. Yes. Kill your ego is among the worst advice I’ve ever heard Right alongside everything happens for a reason & working shit jobs builds character
They actually tricked you into thinking being more technical & scientific about your life would bring you happiness When all it did was confuse you into submission of ur gurus Entire time you had to run the other way back to your animal instincts for clarity and peace
"this is how these phags rope you in Your life will be so dreadfully miserable measuring every gram, checking ur pulse after every sprint, monitoring theta waves that you’ll keep coming back to these clowns for more answers This buffoonery is to designed to break ur will"
Most viscerally cringeworthy tweet I’ve ever seen Making up words for what humans have ordinarily done forever & pretending being outdoors is scientific Zone 2 cardio. Gayest fucking phrase I’ve ever heard
What it’s all about. Surpassing ur mentors
Ppl have mistaken my work to mean grinding 24/7. Not my style at all. I live a siesta life. Mostly resting & then visualize & execute in sprintlike bull rushes. My workouts are 45 min. My calls are quick & poignant. My emails take 10 min to write but I pour it all out
Being super organized is a cope for lack of internal organization Why pro’s still make their free throws w the game on the line despite 50k people jeering at them to miss Environment irrelevant if your core is hard Needing peace & quiet to perform is for amateurs
"The way the world treats ppl manifests in their driving Can literally tell someone’s income level, general attitude about life, athletic talent by subleties in their driving Rare to see a “sharp driver” Most people look and act like corpses inside their cars. Sad really"
Only good news is you can FIX everything AFTER you win. AFTER. NEVER BEFORE. Why most will never even begin
"Troubling that w all the success porn around here no one will tell you the kind of sacrifice it really takes to soar above everyone else Relationships will be shattered, a ton of issues will NOT be fixed, u have to find ways while nothing is working, you have to blur out pain"
I know you don’t get it. Harmony & balance are anathema to excruciating success MANY mechanisms will be broken when you’re monolithically pursuing an impressive objective Personal life will look like a mess from the outside but internally you’re rock solid
Can’t make this shit up folks. From a guy with a face diaper
"Been saying this forever but men are being domesticated at a furious pace Filling the void with tidying things up, being mr homemaker, aesthetics, all gay as fuck and lead men to hell Fake busy work that tricks you into thinking you’re getting shit done"
 and I have lit more American Spirits than a seance at Gettysburg
Women are so nuts nowadays.
Is the female Jussie Smollet? Let’s take a look: 
"Precisely this. It seems the police are not interested in the missing toddler portion of her story, nor do they deem it necessary to warn the public about a potential kidnapper on the loose… Or they simply know that those portions of ’s story are untrue."
Also worth noting that Carlee was treated and released from the hospital in less than 24 hours which allows us to gather that she was not found in a dire physical state— thankfully.
"The Hoover police have now confirmed that only phoned in a report of having seen a toddler wearing a diaper walking down that busy interstate. That is indeed curious. Carlee’s boyfriend has posted an update on Facebook that she was kidnapped, but is now home safe—however the police have not confirmed the kidnapping detail in their update, nor did they deem it necessary to issue a warning for the public at large to remain vigilant. Worth noting this police statement also does not ask the public for help locating the alleged toddler— which in my view is the most critical element of this case. "
Absolute mob scene for at his Turning Point after party
My number one question regarding is whether any other driver on that busy interstate reported seeing a toddler walking along side of it? Most important part of this story is whether there is an at-risk toddler. This is why her story must be further prodded.
"In the (albeit grainy) footage that has since emerged of Carlee stopping on the highway, there is no toddler seen. So yes, people have questions. A missing toddler is a serious enough allegation to maintain public interest until further details unfold. "
"Everyone is happy that was found alive. That said, it is reasonable that we have further questions since there was an alleged toddler wandering alone on the highway, which Carlee reported as a part of this story. Don’t gaslight people for having questions."
"Summer news correction: - RFK Jr. is not antisemetic - Pence did not say American cities are ""not his concern."" - Harris did not promote reducing the human population. The Fine People Hoax happened in the summer too. Ignore all of the summer stories."
"You know what happens at a million, right?"
This is one of the more terrifying news stories I’ve read in a long time. I hope they find this toddler and Carlethia Russell. 
"Just so I’m clear—RFK is now antisemitic because he mentioned an actual scientific study which revealed that Chinese people & ashkenazi Jews were the most immune to COVID-19? He also stated, “We DON’T KNOW whether it was deliberately targeted or not but there are papers out there that show the racial or ethnic differential and impact,” K. This is your daily reminder that virtually everyone in media is insincere and clamoring to baselessly refer to everyone as antisemitic or racist against black people."
"Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian youth have already died because America's foreign policy establishment manipulated their country into war to fulfill vain + futile geopolitical fantasy. Now, rather than acknowledge failure, Biden admin prepares to sacrifice American lives too."
"Women say there are no good men. The truth is there are plenty of good men but many women don’t want to rise to the level of being good women. Basic respect for yourself and your partner isn’t a tall ask. Again, there is nothing wrong with Jonah Hill’s leaked text messages."

"It's weird how any other major public figure would be raked across the coals and forced to resign after being publicly outed with receipts for bribery, but Clarence Thomas is STILL able to rule on cases that will affect millions of Americans. He's not decent enough to resign. It's time to REMOVE Corrupt Clarence from the Supreme Court."
"Good morning and Happy Saturday to everyone who agrees that, contrary to the NRA narrative, MORE guns do NOT make us more safe. There are already 433 million guns, and only 331 million people. How many more guns do we need to be safe? A billion? Ridiculous. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS."
"America is a diverse country. Many different religions are represented. Aside from Christians, there are: Catholic voters Jewish voters Muslim voters Buddhist voters Mormon voters Atheist voters So stop shoving your Christianity down our throats. WE VOTE, TOO."
"I knew that mass murdering creep Robert Card was a coward. Cops found that fucking piece of shit dead by self-inflicted gunshot wound. My heartfelt condolences go out to the families of the victims, I'm sorry they didn't get to see him convicted and sent to prison. He knew he was going to end himself, why did he have to kill all those innocent people? So sickening."
It's obscene that women's bodies are regulated more heavily here than weapons of war.
"FRIENDS: Can we get 1,000 quick replies and retweets to get trending so everyone knows that President Biden's policies have put Americans back to work and keeps our economy growing?"

"I have a logical question for trump supporters: 1. If you accept trump's argument that anything and everything a President does while in office is above prosecution because he has some kind of ""presidential immunity"" 2. AND you also embrace the irrational belief that President Biden is some kind of criminal mastermind who has no problem breaking the law Theoretically, he could then probably do the EXACT same thing that trump is being prosecuted for (the fake electors scheme) to ensure that he stays in office, and avoid prosecution for it, since you believe Presidents are above prosecution. So my question is, does that work for you? Biden does a fake electors scheme, stays in office, and NO jail for him. REMINDER: If President Biden goes to prison for it, trump goes first. Let us know. We'll wait."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: She tried to avoid it, but Ivanka Trump now has to appear in court as a witness against her father in the $250 million financial fraud trial being conducted in New York City. The eldest daughter of disgraced former president Trump has been compelled to appear in person as a witness, although Judge Engoron has granted her some time to file an appeal. Judge Engoron emphasized his preference for in-person testimony, stating, “I want to see her in person. That is how we prefer testimony.” Ivanka's legal team has expressed strong objections to this decision, deeming it ""a bridge too far."" State attorney Kevin Wallace, however, defended the subpoenas by pointing out that Ivanka Trump was a former Trump Organization executive who had significant dealings with lenders for Trump’s Washington D.C. Old Post Office hotel. Wallace added that Ivanka Trump still maintains property ownership and business operations in New York. Judge Engoron justified his ruling by highlighting Ivanka Trump's continued property ownership and business activities in New York, despite her official residency in Florida. How does the news that she'll have to testify against her father make you feel?"

One of the highlights of my year so far was receiving a cease and desist from Jebba Ellis for posting a meme of her. But the meme couldn’t be more accurate. Jebba is a total grifter who should immediately return the $216k she raised in the name of “fighting back” against Fani Willis.

I don’t think Jebba Ellis should’ve been charged in Georgia. But I think it’s an absolute disgrace that she raised $216k from grassroots donors in the name of “fighting back” and then immediately caved. Is she pocketing the money? I think she should return it.

"Jebba Ellis raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to “fight back” against the frivolous Fani Willis charges. Instead, she caved quickly. Just like she did when she was threatened with disbarment in Colorado. Jebba should do the right thing and return the money to the donors."
Is she going to return all the money that she raised to “fight” these charges?

If McCarthy can get over what happened and support Jim Jordan for speaker why can’t the 22 holdouts?! Thank you for doing the right thing.

"3 main takeaways from whatever that was: - It’s shocking that Biden is still alive. He is deteriorating at an unbelievably rapid rate and the fact that Newsom is traveling to Israel right now gives me the growing impression that Biden won’t be the dems’ guy next year. - Another $100B in foreign aid - of your money. Biden is sacrificing our economy; your savings, your retirement, your future, for other countries’ borders while our own border is an unmitigated disaster. - Way too many people have their heads in the sand. We’re 340 million passengers on a ship of fools and when our nation’s men are more interested in the baseball game than they are in the fact that our ruling elites are walking us into WWIII while draining our economy in front of our eyes, we deserve everything that’s coming."
Glad to see that is going to stay and fight! MAGA!
The people across and America can rest assured that I strongly oppose any attempt to create a Democrat backed coalition government. I will vote to support Jim Jordan for Speaker on the House Floor. We must work to unify Republicans as the last line of defense to save America.
Thank you ! A Speaker McHenry would be a gift to the Democrats. Republicans must oppose!
Call your members and encourage them to oppose the McHenry resolution: 202-225-3121
"I obviously support for speaker, but sadly a handful of people are preventing this from happening. If Jordan doesn’t want to keep fighting for this right now, I understand. But he should give up being Speaker Designee so Republicans can get behind someone who is willing to fight. A lot of damage can be done from now until January. A Speaker McHenry would be disastrous and would be a total FU to Republican voters."
"McCarthy needed 15 rounds to become Speaker, so why is Jim Jordan throwing in the towel after only 2?! I think he’d make a great Speaker, but if he’s unwilling to continue fighting, then he needs to withdraw himself as Speaker designee and let someone else step in No McHenry!!"

When you see people getting into strange and muddled arguments online I want you to remember this
Tipper Gore and Nancy Reagan had the dude from Twisted Sister sitting in committee directly asking him if he worships Satan because his dick bulge was too prominent.
"North Dakota GOP senators voted to increase their own meal reimbursements, 10 days after voting against a bill to expand free school lunches for low-income students "
"I wonder why a country with no social safety net, huge barriers to access for health care, and few widely available public utilities has an increased suicide rate"
I’ve been reheating and topping off one cup of coffee since Wednesday
So beside the point but a real shit name for a memoir
"LA has a population of 3.9 Million but only 14 permanent public bathroom stalls on city streets. Not only is bathroom access a human right, it’s a public health issue."
"Gotta hand it to Vox on this one. This is clear, compelling prose about our relationship to animals."

"The courage on display by Rep. Jared Golden cannot be overstated. Golden opposed a ban on assault weapons, admitted he was wrong, and now asks his constituents for forgiveness and urges Congress to ban them. We need more of THIS."
"When Republicans say ""now is not the time to talk about guns,"" reporters should immediately follow up with ""OK, when is the time?"" And keep asking."
"Every Western nation was citizens with mental health problems, but the United States is the only one with almost-daily mass shootings. And with 400 million guns in America, Republicans think the answer is more guns. If Republicans had any sense, they'd ."
"Rep Golden: “I’ve opposed efforts to ban weapons of war like the assault rifle used to carry out this crime. The time has come for me to take responsibility for this failure, which is why I now call on Congress to ban assault rifles.” "
"FRIENDS: The risk of a person in the U.S. dying in a mass shooting was 70% lower during the period of the assault weapons ban. Can we get 1,000 quick replies and retweets to get and garner a wave of support for this critical movement to save lives?"
"PATRIOTS: Do ol' Tea Pain a favor and let's get 1,000 reposts and replies usin' so them folks in DC stop wastin' time and start savin' lives by gettin' rid of them war weapons."
"Good riddance to the Charlottesville statue of traitorous Confederate loser Robert E. Lee, gloriously melted down in a 2,250-degree furnace. It will be repurposed for a new piece of art. How does this make you feel?"
"TWEEPS: Let's send a loud-and-clear message to the NRA, and the politicians owned by them, that we are fed up with the mass shootings. Get these weapons of war off our streets!!! Can we get 1,000 fast RTs and replies using the hashtag so we can get it trending? Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"As our nation reels from the horrific mass shooting in Lewiston, ME, we must be resolute to prevent gun violence. We know from experience that an assault weapons ban save lives. That’s why House Democrats passed a ban last year. It’s past time — we must !"

for anyone saying i’m slut shaming wtf you talking about i love sluts 😂
There is literally nothing wrong with Jonah Hill’s leaked text messages regarding what he wants in a partner. But there is plenty wrong with women in society today. Basic respect for your partner is now being labeled as “misogynistic” from insecure women.
"Good lord, Jemele argued that we (black people) ""fought diligently for Asian American rights."" This is the kind of detached-from-reality logic that earned her promotions at the Detroit Free Press, Orlando Sentinel and ESPN. Or was it Affirmative Action? There is far more proof (and burial plots) of white evangelicals fighting for black American rights than black Americans fighting for the rights of Asians. She's just dumb and dishonest. She's exhibit A in why the elimination of Affirmative Action is necessary. Credentialing idiots is not a good idea."
I was hoping to hit a million followers by July 4th so I can rule the country from the shadows but it looks like I will miss the target by a few days.
How are there still black and white Americans that do not realize how openly racist and hostile this society has become toward white people. Can you imagine ANY journalist publishing an article with the title “mediocre blacks can rest easier”? Appallingly racist. 
And the audacity given the fact that her children are literally benefiting from legacy admissions at Harvard. It really is clown world sometimes.
The university system is the most elaborate and expensive scam of all time. Most people come out of it dumber and less qualified than they were going in. It does not teach any useful skills. You do not need it to succeed in life. It bankrupts millions of young Americans and gives them nothing in return. Maybe we should focus on that problem instead of “loan forgiveness”
"I don’t know about you but I’m starting to think that liberals showing up outside of the Supreme Court Justices’ homes and threatening to kill them over Roe v. Wade, did not age well."
"If white people would like to have a greater presence in the NBA, then they are going to have to work at their jump shots. If black people would like to have a greater presence at Harvard, then we are going to have to work at our academics. This is not hard."
I am not bothered by the fact that black Americans dominate Asian and white Americans in basketball and football. We are simply better at those sports and the best players who train the hardest and therefore score the most points should play. This isn’t complicated.
Imagine if the NBA declined Lebron James because there were “too many black people in the NBA” and they wanted racial diversity—so they instead allowed Ed Sheeran onto the Lakers in his place. That is exactly what Asian-Americans have been enduring for decades at Harvard.
I just can’t get over how implausibly stupid this is. Everyone’s debating affirmative action and is over here like: K BUT WHY DIDN’T THEY JUST DECIDE ON A CASE THAT WAS NEVER BROUGHT BEFORE THEM?! How is she just allowed to be this unabashedly thick in public life?
She quite literally has no idea what the function of the Supreme Court is or what the case was before them. There is no bottom to her stupidity.
"How devastating for Michelle Obama to learn that whether someone is black or white or Hispanic, or Asian—they will all be treated the same in the college admissions process. What will black America do without racist, preferential treatment?"
"Exactly this. Transgenderism is, among other things, an utterly fictitious “civil rights” movement, comprised mostly of a bunch of mentally deranged gay men that are looking for permission to live out their sexual fetishes publicly."
"Case in point: here is Dylan “I’m scared to leave my house” Mulvaney pictured last week, wearing an 800$ bra with Olivia Wilde. The whole lot of you need to just stfu with your fake victim act."
No one threatened to kill Dylan Mulvaney. We threatened to (and made good on) no longer drinking Bud Light. I’m so sick of the “trans community” pretending they are black people surviving the klan in the 1920’s—while their shake their fake implants on the White House lawn.

you are 41 years of age making a collage of twitter accounts
"No black person will be able to succeed based on merit? LOL Wow. She really just went ahead and said the quiet part out loud. Astounding, unabashed racism. This is what democrats have always thought of black people."
The Ron DeSantis strategy of running for president by acting like the most boring cubicle employee from the Office Space movie is not working.
What a great day for Asian Americans who have endured flagrant educational discrimination because…they do everything right. So glad that you will finally get into the schools that you deserve to get into based on the hard work you put in. is over.
"It even harms the black people it purports to help who are relegated to academic probation for having been artificially mismatched into schools, whereas they might succeed were they placed into other schools based upon their intellectual merit."
"An unfortunate but true conclusion I’ve reached is that voters don’t have a worldview, they have a Guy. There’s how they understand the world. Their Man is good. Other Man Bad. It’s why so many “influencers” degrade themselves by pandering and lying. Some don’t want to do this!"
Easily the most interesting candidates in the field.
"Sorry to the say it but the Desantis campaign was dead on arrival and it’s time to admit it. Tons of mistakes. Needed to be more upfront about his intention to run. Doesn’t come across as honest and he’s boring. (You can say it shouldn’t matter but it does). He also needed someone more like Kayleigh McEnany rather than petty Christina Pushaw running comms. The influencers that are still cheerleading for him are those that recently moved to his state and want to reap the benefits for standing firm beside him through his inevitable loss. I’m not knocking the influencer-hustle, just calling it as I see it. They know he can’t win either."
I sleep well knowing that people are mad at me for calling out Trump when he baselessly attacks someone like Kayleigh. Mad at me for agreeing with RFK. Jr on vaccines. Mad at me for stating the obvious that Desantis won’t win but IS a good Governor. It’s good to be free.
"I’d still support him as Governor. What’s become clear to me is he resents not just Trump— but more problematically, his supporters. I think he’s honestly disgusted by Trump supporters. He and his team are grossed out by small town-people. That’s the vibe I catch."
Also their weird takeover of their community notes gives people a “fact-checker” vibe. Sometimes the notes they add don’t actually debunk anything. Getting very Snopes-like. ( please don’t community note my opinion!)
"It’s important to note that the SCOTUS decision is very narrow Only 9 states ban affirmative action. If you’re a state legislator, you should be putting forward a bill to ban it in your state."
"Wow!! Affirmative action, something I have spoken out against for the last 7 years, has FINALLY been struck down in a historic Supreme Court ruling. This is a MAJOR WIN in the strive for racial equality, removing the bigotry of low expectations against black students, while permitting Asian and white Americans an EQUAL chance to be rewarded for their hard work. RACE should never be a factor in deciding whether or not you are qualified for anything. It’s a shame it took this long, but finally— justice wins! Make America a meritocracy again. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
"To be clear, I won’t be voting for him due to other policy disagreements but I hope he is platformed everywhere. The work he is doing is that important."
"Robert F Kennedy Jr. is the most important candidate in the presidential field. Millions of children will be saved because of him. Finally, those of us who have spoken out against the predatory childhood vaccination schedule & the associated injuries are reaching critical mass."
This was entirely foreseeable and preventable. A Sunday Times investigation in 2028 found 88% of sexual offences committed in changing rooms and public bathrooms take place in those that are unisex. 1/2 
"I no longer hate pride month. It’s now become the month where perverts prove conservatives right. We just get to sit back, let them be what they are, and watch people wake up to the social illness that pervades. We win this month."
"This is your daily reminder that the concept of transgenderism and “gender identity” was created by white, male, pedophile psychologists who experimented upon and sexually assaulted minor children. Keep gay pedophiles away from children. "
"Great news, everyone: Putin is losing the war in Iraq! We are nation headed by a corrupt, senile, imbecile."

Why is everyone so sensitive? What if everyone just shut up and stopped crying?
The community note added to this is amazing. caught red handed trying to cover for pedophiles. The article headline should read “Pedophilia is a gay historical right” — because that’s what they are implying.
I’m literally sick of everyone. Perpetual victims everywhere.
"The Roseanne Barr fake scandal is proof that everybody is insincere. Everyone waits on the sidelines waiting to cancel someone for being either racist or antisemitic. EVERYONE knows she was being satirical and nobody cares because we are a nation of childish, over-emotional, insincere babies."
"Would you forgive your mother if she raised you as a little girl, despite knowing and never telling you that you were a boy? "
"I should clarify that I’m not alleging he’s guilty or innocent. As usual, I react to facts and not public emotion and in this particular circumstance, I am left wanting more concrete information and evidence. If anybody has any, please share!"
This article should be trending. 
"Bryan Kohberger case is odd and I’d love for lawyers to weigh in on it. Seems unusual that they gagged the victims’ families and that there has been such an utter lack of information given to the public regarding such a major case. Now his defense is alleging they recovered none of victims’ DNA in his car, apartment, home, or office and that the FBI used 23 and me to tie him to the scene and that the the FBI won’t be forthcoming with their tactics."
"The Bryan Kohberger case is odd. Gagging the victims’ families from speaking seems unusual. The lack of evidence shared with the public regarding such a major case. Now his lawyer is alleging there is no DNA tying the victims to his car, home, office, or vehicle and that the FBI used 23 and me tactics to tie him to the crime scene?"
Everyone stared to notice stuff happening. Special Ed went from a couple of kids to huge departments. Vaccines? No one knows. But we are being gas lit. SOMETHING happened. What? You’re not supposed to even ask.
So many parents waking up. Don’t let Big Pharma poison your kids. I refuse all vaccinations when I am pregnant. My kids are unvaxxed and I will never stop screaming that while I have a platform to do so. Listen to mothers.
"Pedophiles and perverts. Vermin of our society. This has nothing to do with freedom or love and if you aren’t awake to that now, it’s because you’re an idiot."
"I maintain that western citizens are the most uneducated and propagandized people in the world. “Putin bad, so coup good.” Monkey-stupid understandings and assessments that stem from (as Tucker Carlson put it) our citizenry having been lied to at full volume over many years."
Do we really believe Putin is just going to let this one go? No punishment for the soldiers or Prigozhin? Not so sure about that.
"If Putin goes down, it’s likely the next Russian leader won’t hesitate to use nukes. Be careful what you wish for. Propagandized western citizens truly underestimate how much we are hated for destabilizing another region of the world via our military industrial complex."
Men in dresses are creepy. This is OBVIOUS TRUTH. J Edgar Hoover also a cross dresser as many serial killers were. Time to be honest about this stuff.

He is using his position in congress so he can get more followers and then get more money when he joins cnn. Shameful behavior. It’s exactly what Adam Kinzinger did. should do the right thing and vote for JIM JORDAN!"
"Great form tackle, sister. Also why do climate cultists always look so nutty?!"
"NEW: Trump plans to reinstate and expand his travel ban, deport Jihadists and their ""sympathizers,"" revoke visas, MORE "
Former Speaker McCarthy has taken the high road and is supporting . It’s clear that cares more about getting a little bit of fame than getting congress back to work. I hope Bacon ends up doing the right thing on round 2. But who knows

Very cool. Thank you AG 🇺🇸 Iowa is MAGA country!
Exactly right. The liberal crusade against President Trump never ends. We can’t roll over and allow them to shamelessly attack the First Amendment and interfere in the 2024 election. This must be appealed immediately and we must stand strong in defense of our democracy.
One of the holdouts is . It’s been reported that Ken is considering leaving Congress to sign a contributors contract with CNN. It’s clear that he is only holding out to bolster his name ID so his contract is more valuable.

THE GROUP CHAT GUYS (1/2)
VEGAS WE ARE IN YOU
"Rediscover your disgust response. This will solve 90% of society’s problems. Gross stuff is gross. Don’t rationalize it. Creepy people are creepy. First impressions are almost always right, and the few exceptions to the rule aren’t worth disregarding the fundamental truth for."
There are two black Americas right now. The microphone-snatching liar represents a version of black America that has rotted due to low educational & cultural standards. But many other black Americans want absolutely nothing to do with that.
"Many of you saw the video of that hood rat at graduation, essentially assaulting her administrator. Please note that there are plenty of black people who were also graduating that day and who are calling her out on her lies. Not all black condone that sort of behavior."
"The trans agenda was invented by pedophilic psychologists, degenerate quacks, lunatic sexologists, literal Nazi scientists, and other assorted deviants. A collection of the most despicable monsters imaginable came up with all of this stuff. Here are five names you should know."
It is sad the CEO of Oceangate ignored repeated warnings about safety in pursuit of adventure. It is sad that a 19 year old whose life was just beginning was onboard. 5 lives ended. People laughing at this are despicable I am glad to learn they did not suffer. 
"We all know this day would come. Finally, I agree with and everything she said about the submarine stepson from hell. "
Hunter Biden used shell corps to hide the transfer of millions of dollars in an effort to evade taxes. Money laundering. Not to mention that this income was made from unregistered lobbying for foreign oligarchs. This deal isn’t normal and no credible lawyer would say otherwise.
"Last week on my podcast I covered Lance Bass, Megan Fox, Vivek Ramashwamy, Dave Rubin, Prince Harry, Conor McGregor and Andrew Tate. BuT mUh JuNeTeEnTH!! Generally speaking, black people today are emotional silly putty and cannot take any criticism without crying racism."
"I am not kidding when I say that over 90% of my podcast content criticizes white people in politics and culture. But because black people are soft, emotional and have had their brains rotted by BLM, in the rare circumstances that I cover a black topic they cry like bitches."
"WITHOUT Googling, name a famous historic battle."
Black America should definitely be taking cues on which holidays to celebrate from a man who believes that men can menstruate and give birth.
Uh-oh. A black intellectual has entered the chat…
"If you need your hand held, there are plenty of black and white liberal commentators to choose from that are training black Americans to feel proud of the rot that surrounds them. I am not one of them."
"Foremost, black American culture has gotten ghetto. I know you’re used to the media lying to black Americans pretending that high murder rates, illiterate children, and degenerate music is “progress”, bc “oh look, we gave you Juneteenth!”— but I’m not falling for the bullshit."
"Pride month is ghetto too, as are the overwhelming majority of these holidays and celebrations that are about nothing other than dividing people. (Disclaimer: pride month is also about debauchery, sexual perversion, and pedophilia)"
Be sure to leave your milk and cookies out—maybe Joe Biden will bring you those reparations Democrats keep promising you. Absolute fools. But enjoy your pander of a holiday. 
Juneteenth is still ghetto and made up. Hope everyone enjoys it!
"If you don't see the sterilization and butchery of children as ""conversion therapy"" then you are not merely wilfully but evilly blind "
Happy Father’s Day to all the fathers even the dads who won’t debate their views in public when offered over a million dollars for medical charities!

"They aren’t experts, they’re authoritarians."
"First 3 episodes are free. If you enjoy what you hear, you can then make a decision to watch the entire series, available exclusively on . "
"Anyways, I have to go to bed. If I’ve piqued your interest and you’d like to learn more on vaccines, I have an entire series entitled “A Shot in the Dark”. It is easily the most important work I do, and it’s entirely apolitical. Start here for free: "
And yes SIDS is literally listed as an adverse event on multiple vaccine inserts available on the FDA website. Any pediatrician trying to make you believe that an infant “suddenly dying” is not plausibly related to vaccines is a liar.
I feel sad for parents who really believe that sleeping their children on their back is preventing them from SIDS. More Big Pharma smoke and mirrors! They changed post-Mortem requirements to trick parents. My unvaxxed kids slept on their tummies. 
"A special LOL to those of you who thought it was the poor, ignorant people that weren’t vaccinating their children. It’s the wealthy, affluent people. They can literally afford not to poison their kids. If vaccines are really “life-saving” why are rich people opting out?"
"Gosh, I wonder why there was this huge outbreak of kids becoming paralyzed in 40’s?!"
"“We eliminated polio!” No. You changed the diagnostic definition of polio after you rolled out the vaccine and after you stopped mass-paralyzing children and animals with big pharma approved DDT, after realizing it LITERALLY causes paralysis. WATCH: "
Pertussis outbreaks keep happening exclusively amongst vaccinated kids. They blame unvaccinated kids anyways. 😂😂 
"Once you realize that the same people that profit off the vaccines also control the medical schools, you will realize that you are literally being controlled by a medical cartel. Do your research. Do not trust ANY medical professional that gets angry when you ask questions."
"This one kills me the most. Like how the hell does a doctor convince you that your child needs a vaccine against sexually transmitted disease, as soon as they come out of the womb?"
"Yeah my bad, this rant could have been more organized. Lol"
"Not Canada, Mexico, or any European country engages in this. Just America. Big pharma lied and said it was “more sanitary” and would prevent penile cancers. They no longer stand by this lie. Your baby son’s foreskin leaves the hospital to be sold in beauty products."
"Typically this is seen as a religious rite, which is why only predominantly Jewish and Muslim countries have high rates of circumcision (but even these countries wait until the 8th day.) The American medical system is an abomination."
"Think it’s just vaccines? Wait until you learn why the United States is the ONLY country in the western world that is circumsizing infant boys minutes out of the womb. (If you guessed that there is a market for infant foreskin, you’d be correct) "
Not sure who controls Twitter notes but if you’re wondering the source of this chart it’s the journal of American Medicine Association.
This chart kills me. Only 601 cases of tetanus before the vaccines in the U.S Now every parent thinks their child is going to die from stepping on a rusty nail. Where did they get that idea? From Big Pharma ads. Today 1 in 36 kids has autism. This insanity needs to stop.
"Virtually no one was dying of Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Chickenpox, Tetanus in the United States. It’s insane that parents don’t know this and genuinely fear these diseases so much that they put their children at risk for cancer, seizures, lifelong mental impairment, autoimmune disorders and sudden death."
"Speak to kids today and they are terrified of chicken pox because Big Pharma has lied about it. Parents will risk giving their children lifelong autoimmune disorders, cancer, sudden infant death, etc bc Big Pharma has made them arbitrarily fearful of getting sick for a few days."

"‘Anti-Woke’ Firms PublicSq ($PSQH) and Rumble (NASDAQ: $RUM) Sponsor Florida GOP’s Presidential Candidate Forum The forum will feature Florida Gov. Ron Desantis and the 45th President, Donald J. Trump "
No Republican will be able to beat in a primary. Republicans should all get behind Kari so we can focus on flipping that seat in 2024. Thank you !
Great to see Republicans uniting behind for Speaker!
Great to see! Time for house republicans to unite behind so we can get to holding the Biden crime family accountable for selling out our nation!
A political activist pretending to be a judge is mulling an order that would prevent Trump from “invective” against “perceived enemies.” If you gag Trump in the middle of a campaign it’s a direct assault on the First Amendment and the judge should be immediately impeached.
"Frank LaRose endorses AMNESTY and then gets called out by Bernie Moreno at last night's Ohio US Senate Candidate Forum: ""It's not realistic to take 20 million consumers out of the economy, to take 20 million workers out of the economy."" - ""I am deeply offended by the fact that this country rewards people who cut in front of the millions of people who are waiting. You're rewarding them by allowing them to stay."" - "
"It would be cool if Republicans could unite in attacking Biden on whatever the hell this answer is, instead of Donald Trump for stating obvious truths"
Excellent. Thank you and ! Egypt and other Middle East countries should take them in. Not us!
"Why won’t Egypt open its borders to allow refugees from Gaza in? They should go there, not here! Republicans should call on Egypt and other middle eastern nations to step up!"
Get out and vote for !
President Trump was the greatest foreign policy president in modern history! Bring him back!
People are waking up. and his admin officials like helped bring peace and stability to the world. Joe Biden has brought nothing but chaos and destruction. If you care about saving lives and making the world a better place VOTE TRUMP!
"“Ron DeSantis has become a sad, bitter, angry, little man because Republican voters have widely rejected him in favor of President Trump.” I joined Newsmax to defend Israel’s greatest ally, , from the DeSantis created hoax about “praising terrorists.” Trump 2024"
President and worked incredibly well together during Trump’s first term and they will work together to eradicate Hamas and Hezbollah in his next term! Trump 2024!

Lol. You mean the same chickenpox that me and all my sisters had back in the 90’s when we were literally having “chicken pox parties”? Oh no….so scary. Big Pharma come to the rescue!
The pro-vax community never debates. They just censor because they are lying about absolutely everything. I will never vaccinate my healthy children. Big pharma is the greatest evil on the face of the planet.
"Update: since I made this video, even more footage has been released—this time of the accuser hanging out with Conor McGregor, AFTER her alleged “violent rape”. Honestly, too many women in this day and age positively disgust me. "
"This man stabbed 14-year-old Karen Slattery 18 times, killing her, then raped her corpse. He committed murder again years later. The only injustice in Owen’s case is that it took the state 40 years to execute him"
Today— Vladimir Putin tells West to “go to hell” and confirms that he’s moved nuclear weapons to Belarus as a precaution. Boris Johnson writes a column about how injecting himself with Wegovy for weight loss made him vomit. We are just not serious people in the West.
Women need to face the same time in prison as their would-be perpetrators when they are caught in flagrant lies about having been sexually assaulted and/or raped. It could all be so simple.
I love watching Sergei Polunin dance.
There are a lot of things you might expect a former Prime Minister to do once he has left office but writing a column about throwing up because you injected yourself with Ozempic to lose weight? This is not one of them. Utterly embarrassing. 
"FYI—The woman in this narrative is already changing her story. She at first said she was forced into the bathroom by his security, but now that video has been released debunking this claim she admits she went willingly. NBA finals, cameras everywhere—how could she be so daft?"
"If you believe that Connor McGregor attempted to rape a woman, but then she “elbowed him and escaped”. You are an absolute idiot. In what fiction world does a female elbow take out Conor McGregor? Her attorney should have advised her to deeply reconsider that narrative."
"🧵1/ BREAKING: We've obtained internal docs from employees. Fox Corp is celebrating Pride by encouraging employees to read about “glory holes,” supporting a group that gives sterilizing hormones to homeless youth, & deployed woke AI to monitor everyone. EXPLICIT CONTENT:"
This Woman Was Literally Fired for Being White...
"When gay marriage was being debated, there was so much chatter from people claiming that conservatives and religious zealots were bigoted for believing it would somehow usher in an era of sheer sexual perversion. I wonder what those people are saying now."
Do I sense patriarchal disbelief? Every girl I know has been kidnapped at least once in broad daylight at an NBA finals game by one of the most famous men in the world.
"There’s also pup-play. Where gay men can wear leather and be walked around like dogs with butt plugs. I learned this from Men’s Health magazine. It isn’t is a fetish btw, it’s FREEDOM. You conservatives and your homophobia just don’t get it."
"I believe this is what the “queer” identity denotes: a “sexual identity that does not correspond to established ideas of sexuality”. Don’t you dare suggest this man is grotesque. Especially during PRIDE otherwise-known-as-sexual-fetish month, you bigot."
"Disclaimer: these aren’t the only types of individuals that I pre-judge. Please tune into my weekday podcast for a more extensive list, available on Apple and Spotify."
"If you mean to suggest that I am prejudiced against certain groups, you would be correct. Generally speaking, men that want to wear female panties and gain access to children are the types of people I pre-judge."

I will be streaming my show live on Twitter today at 12:30pm CST. See you there!
"Wow. Heartbroken to learn that Rose Montoya, the White House lawn soft core porn-star, blocked me—despite me being his number one public advocate. Despite this hiccup, I pledge to continue to seek justice for trannies who are honest about their freak fetishes, get invited to civilized establishments anyway, and then are unjustly admonished for behaving like the perverts they’ve always been. "
The American neo-con-neo-lib-war-mongering uni-party absolutely must be defeated. We all know who they are.
"Joe Biden is condemning this act to save face with his voters— not because he has an actual problem with it. So no, I won’t be praising him for this utter act of cowardice."
You’re missing the point entirely. Biden is only condemning this act because his voters were outraged. He invited this individual to the White House fully knowing what this individual was and exactly how they behaved in public. His entire Instagram is dedicated to debauchery.
Now the is turning its back on Rose for doing what Rose openly advocates for as a living— exposing children. is being a coward. The administration got exactly what they ordered and now they are trying to blame what occurred on an openly mentally ill man.
Rose Montoya is the name of the man who exposed his surgically-created breasts to young children at the White House. The invited Rose knowing fully well that he advocates for teaching sex to young children. He advocates for this openly on his Instagram page.
It would be like hosting a party for toddlers and then being upset that one of them spilled or made a mess. Utterly wrong to blame the people you invited for behaving exactly as they’ve always behaved. We all know what pride month is. 🤢
"The LGTQIA plus community has always been clear about the fact that they glorify nudity, pornography and sexual fetishes which are staples at pride events. got what he ordered. Now he’s being a coward and scapegoating one mentally ill man. Pride month is filth."
We are live on Facebook right now with my heartfelt questions to the gay community. fb.watch/l8oFjKyT_t/?mibexti…
"If your parents are alive, still together, live nearby and can help you raise your kids, you are blessed. If you have enough money to stay at home, you are blessed. If you can afford home care, you are blessed— but the messaging cannot be that if you do not fall into one of these categories, you have somehow failed as a parent."
"My kids are not in daycare. That said, the new “conservative” trend of bashing mothers who, like many people in my family, cannot afford to keep their kids at home is completely out of touch."
We are live on Facebook right now discussing my YouTube suspension! fb.watch/l74d4KVLVG/
"‼️It’s true, my YouTube account has been suspended and here is what I have to say: We don’t know exactly what or who is the driving force behind globally-sanctioned lies, but what we do know is that over the past five years, the prevailing lies of the day have shifted dramatically. It was Black Lives Matter in 2020 when corporations, governments, and Hollywood were in lockstep flying black-fist flags and encouraging people to donate their money as a penance, for the sin of being born white. Then the lie switched rather dramatically to COVID. People were encouraged to mask-up, avoid their family members, roll up their sleeves and submit to a “safe and effective vaccine” via a globally-sponsored lie that it would protect them from getting a virus. Of course, both of these tremendous lies fell a part with time. The corporation of Black Lives Matter was revealed to be fraudulent— siphoning money away from well-meaning citizens in order to enrich—not black Americans of course—but various transgendered causes as well as the BLM founder’s close circle of family and friends. Today, the new and perhaps most insidious globally agreed upon lie is that individuals can choose or magically switch their genders. Why is this lie the most insidious? Other than its frightful illumination of western idiocy, it’s the most insidious because it targets children, specifically. If it needs reminding, there exists no world and certainly no cultural moment in which I become a buck that can be broken. Just as with the previous globally-sanctioned lies, I will in no way submit to it. Like in the previous globally-perpetuated circumstances, me and those who stand against it will be maimed and caricatured in the media. And then just like in those previous circumstances, the few of us with the courage to stand against the tides of pop-fiction will be vindicated. Because in the end, truth wins. Until then."

This Black Girl Just Accused Me of Racism
I’ve read the indictment and unfortunately do not have any 🍭 to hand out. - It’s selective prosecution. - It calls the legitimacy of our judicial system into question and leads this country on a dark path. - Trump walked into this trap. What a mess.
This is worth a read.
"Eczema, seizures, sudden infant death— all listed as potential side effects in the FDA inserts for these vaccines that they do not give parents. Freely available online. "
Please watch my series A Shot in the Dark which I produced for DW+. I’m passionate about this issue & regularly let people know my children are completely unvaccinated. Unvaxxed children are healthier than vaxxed children. No doctor can dispute this fact. 
"So brilliantly said. “You have to be lied to, at full volume for years” to believe some of the absurd shit that Americans fall for. Zelensky is so obviously an oligarch war criminal. The military industrial complex is clearly waging a proxy war with Russia. Stop being obtuse."
Tired of the term “conservative”. Everyone thinks they are a conservative if they agree with the right on one major common sense issue. I believe in natural order. People that stand in opposition to any element of this are not working to “conserve” the same things as me.
"TRUTH. 1. God is real. 2. There are two genders. 3. Human flourishing requires fossil fuels. 4. Reverse racism is racism. 5. An open border is no border. 6. Parents determine the education of their children. 7. The nuclear family is the greatest form of governance known to mankind. 8. Capitalism lifts people up from poverty. 9. There are three branches of the U.S. government, not four. 10. The U.S. constitution is the strongest guarantor of freedoms in history."

I should note that I do personally use someone’s preferred pronouns, just as I use someone’s preferred name, simply from the standpoint of good manners. However, for the same reason, I object to rude behavior, ostracism or threats of violence if the wrong pronoun or name is used."
. will be leading a conversation about this tonight at 7:30pm ET. Set a reminder here: 
Twitter canceled a deal with to premiere What is a Woman? for free on the platform because of two instances of “misgendering.” I’m not kidding. Here's what happened:🧵1/16
"I guess Lizzo wasn’t lying when she said “truth hurts”. But yeah, clinical obesity is still the number 1 killer in America so let’s stop glorifying it. "
Tell me you pop prescription pills without telling me you pop prescription pills
Any person telling Trump that attacking Kayleigh is a good or justifiable idea simply does not have his best interests at heart. It’s sloppy and any worthy strategist would tell him as much.
They still have not been charged with anything. This is insanely corrupt. These three have quite literally been imprisoned for nothing. Romania is looking for a crime. What is driving this nonsense?
There are a lot of pedophiles in positions of power. Grown men that are heavily in support of teaching young children sexuality and transgenderism always give me pedophile-vibes. Keep your children far away from these men. I’m deadly serious.
But he also backstabs. He flips on his biggest supporters over the slightest misunderstandings. He should have called her. His attack on her was in poor taste.
Trump leveling personal attacks against over something as stupid as her getting a poll wrong by 9 points is absolute trash. None of us went through what she went though personally or professionally during the Trump years. Why not call her rather than trash her?
"Deciding where you spend your money is not cancel culture, you dweeb. It’s called “the free markets”."
"While the Bud Light protest was definitively led by moral men, I believe this Target one is being led by moral women and I’m very glad to see these results. Keep it up. "

Ron DeSantis’ lies continue to backfire. Even people that have endorsed Ron (there aren’t many) are saying his claim that Trump is “anti-Israel” is totally false!
The greatest friend to Israel!
Speaker Jim Jordan. Let’s get it done!
Jim Jordan is a conservative fighter who can unite our party and he continues to have my full support to be the next Speaker of the House.
“There was no better friend or ally of Israel than President Donald J. Trump.” So true !
Nancy Mace is right. The world was a much safer place under . Trump 2024!
Incredible ratio. No one believes the Murdoch’s propaganda anymore.
DeSantis has dropped in the betting markets after he and his team lied about Trump “praising” terrorists. He is now solidly behind Nikki Haley. Trump 2024!
"A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists…Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land, and drive them out of his Earth!” - Trump to Muslim leaders in the Middle East, 2017"

proshippers “aging up” a character
The fake “looming debt crisis” drama takes place every year followed by its umpteenth-hour agreement to rescue America from the brink of default. LOL. D.C is theatre.
Wonderful to see that this crook is finally facing consequences. Now return the mansions. 
Today I learned that there is an actual worship service out in San Francisco called “Beyoncé Mass”. They use her as the focus of their worship songs and the pastor believes Beyonce is deeper than most theologians. California is hell on earth. 
Make calls. Ken Paxton is a legend. Cannot even believe they are trying to take him out. 
Excellent segment by regarding Desantis. Describing him as “rehearsed” and his influencer-fans as “Pravda-esque” hits the nail on the head. A “pen and paper guy” who is way too “rehearsed”. 
Some of you guys did not understand the danger of a grown man like Dylan Mulvaney self-identifying as a little girl. Maybe now you will. It’s transgenderism first and then pedophilia. An inevitability when society pushes the idea that adults don’t have to acknowledge reality.
He is poisoning the child with discharge laced with synthetic hormones in order to satisfy his fetish. A just society would throw men like this in prison.
My heart breaks for women who— for money—submit their bodies to this cruel practice. It is the highest paying form of prostitution and that there are wealthy women who subject poorer women to this cruelty out of vanity and not necessity makes me sick. 
I am grateful that has shone a light on the unethical practice of surrogacy. Purchasing and taking a newborn from its mothers arms a mere seconds after birth is an unspeakable evil. Breeders do not even do it to animals. 
8.2 billion in one week. This isn’t meant to be temporary. Swear off for life. Their executives are predators. Children have to be our bottom line. 
Totally agree. Excellent Governor.
"I would gladly have RFK on my show—in fact, I’ll have my team reach out now. I’m very confused why people think what I can and cannot say is somehow controlled."
I know you meant this as an insult but Cruella DeCandace has a nice ring to it.
The funniest responses to DeSantis running for president:
Both more interesting than Desantis. Personality matters and people don’t want to admit that.
Bill Clinton has “it”. Obama has “it.” Trump has “it”. Hillary didn’t have it . Desantis doesn’t have it. “It” isn’t fair but it wins presidential elections.
"Stop talking to me about Desantis’ qualifications. Based on qualifications, he should have destroyed Andrew Gillum. Instead, he almost lost to an overt socialist. Why? Because Andrew Gillum has charisma. Stop deluding yourselves. The “it factor” matters. Obama had “it”."
Zelensky tried to assassinate a sitting President of another country. This should be dominating the headlines. We are fighting a proxy war with Russia via corrupt Ukraine and are on the brink of igniting a world war.
"I would be very keen to hear Desantis’ thoughts on Zelensky and Ukraine, and his overall thesis on America sending money overseas. Crucial to me and many others."

"Governor DeSantis’ government paid press secretary posted a picture of me with a fabricated quote about Hezbollah attributed to me. I don’t know why the Governor would authorize this, or maybe he doesn’t know, but the quote is fake. Thank you."
West Virginia is MAGA country! and are up BIG!
"After refuses to endorse term limits at the Ohio US Senate Candidate Forum, torches him for being a career politician who immediately started planning his run for US Senate after just getting elected Secretary of State."
The most pro-Israel President ever. Anyone saying otherwise is a disgusting liar.
Ron DeSantis is pushing the same lies as Liz Cheney now. Ron has completely sold his soul to the swamp. What a pathetic loser
"Yes tell us again, foreign policy geniuses."
"TFW you convince your boss to call Trump “anti-Israel” even though Trump ended the Iran nuclear deal, eradicated Isis, moved the embassy to Jerusalem, recognized the golan heights, signed the Abraham accords, and was the greatest friend israel has ever had in the White House."
"President Trump was clearly pointing out how incompetent Biden and his administration were by telegraphing to the terrorists an area that is susceptible to an attack. Smart does not equal good. It just proves Biden is stupid. And now you look stupid, Ron."
"Ron DeSantis’ Twitter has turned into Lincoln Project What a disgraceful lie from a sad, bitter, and failed candidate who would still be a backbencher in Congress if Trump hadn’t promoted him"
"DeSantis is really going with the message of “the president that moved the embassy to Jerusalem, recognized the golan heights, eradicated isis, and signed the Abraham accords is anti-Israel.” You can’t make this sh*t up. He is such a fraud and a clown."
Team desantis is trying to create their own “Charlottesville very fine people” hoax. Such desperate and pathetic losers. Team DeSantis is worse than the left.
"Donald Trump is the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House. He destroyed ISIS, killed Solemani, moved the embassy to Jerusalem, and signed the Abraham Accords. It’s absolutely disgusting that the desantis campaign is taking Trump’s words out of context to try to paint him as anti-Israel. DeSantis has allowed the morons running his campaign to ruin his entire image and chances of ever being President. Such desperate losers."
Donald Trump will destroy Hamas like he destroyed ISIS when he returns to the Oval Office.
BREAKING: Why do we allow people like this in our country? Denaturalize and Deport them. It is our decision who is allowed to be in our country and who isn't

"Again, this is plainly based on my show metrics so far from a perfect science but interesting; People were interested in Vivek, Trump— but every breakout I do regarding Desantis is a guaranteed tank. For reference, a debate on the Catholic faith did 200k views in 15 hours."
"To be honest I was more interested in hearing from Elon than I was in hearing from Desantis and I know I’m not the only one. Just based on my show metrics—(YouTube segment views) whether I’m giving him credit or critiquing him, people are not interested when I cover Desantis."
They missed. Big time. Trump 2024.
Rep. is a HERO! 
"“One thing I can say with absolute certainty is that if President Trump was in office, this never would’ve happened.” - Jared worked closely with on securing peace in the Middle East and he has SPOT ON analysis about what’s happening in Israel right now."
🚨President Trump’s pro-Israel policies led to the Abraham Accords and groundbreaking achievements on the path towards peace in the Middle East! Jared is 100% correct! This would not be happening with President Trump in the White House.
"For what it’s worth, Kinzinger was totally against and now he’s all in for Steve Scalise…"
What and admin officials like were able to accomplish in the Middle East was truly incredible. We need the Trump Admin back!! Trump 2024!
Incredible. Rep. is on the ground in Israel personally rescuing Americans that have been trapped there. Cory Mills also flew to Afghanistan to rescue Americans after Biden’s disastrous withdrawal. 
"In 2018, President Trump exited Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions on their oil. However, Biden employed lax enforcement of those sanctions as Tehran worked with and sold their oil with the help of China and Venezuela. Biden’s move is so lucrative to Iran that their oil exports reached record levels in 2022. All of this done under the foolish guise that Iran would be more open to negotiate a nuclear deal. Biden is so desperate to repeat Obama’s failures that he allowed Iran to make untold billions from oil.” Great op-ed from "
The people want Trump back!
"Look how uncomfortable RFK got when confronted with his past positions, he dismissed them as ""talking points from the Trump campaign"" lol... these frauds always react the same way."
"Another DeSantis “influencer” jumping ship. Jebba Ellis, Steve Cortes, and now Steve Dunce."
We need in the United States Senate!
Vote for Trump if you want to avoid World War 3!
President Trump will reimpose the travel ban on terror-afflicted countries!

Not just the leading Republican candidate… He’s also leading Biden! Trump 2024!
Remember what they took from you… WORLD PEACE. Trump 2024!
The world would be at peace right now if was still in the White House. Instead we have this. Rigged elections have consequences. Bring back Trump!
President and delivered peace in the Middle East and throughout the world. Under Biden it’s back to chaos and carnage.
"President Trump: ""When I was your President, we had PEACE through STRENGTH, now we have weakness, conflict, and chaos. The atrocities we are witnessing in Israel would never have happened."" So true."
The people want Trump back!
Biden has blood on his hands
"Given the horrifying images we've seen in Israel, America must take action immediately to protect our own nation and borders. Iran’s leaders and the terrorists chant ""death to Israel,"" and ""death to America."" We must prepare to secure Americans and be proactive, not reactive."
"EXCLUSIVE: Ken Paxton Files Criminal Complaints Against House Impeachment Managers, Reports Crimes Read all about it here first for : "
It is abhorrent and heinous that Harvard student groups are blaming Israel for Hamas’ barbaric terrorist attacks that have killed over 700 Israelis. Any voice that excuses the slaughter of innocent women and children has chosen the side of evil and terrorism. I am calling on the leadership of to immediately publicly condemn these vile anti-Semitic statements.
"Trump has a track record of defending Israel, not just with tweets or political statements,"" said , pointing to moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, the institution of the Abraham Accords, & killing Qasem Soleimani. "
Biden is responsible for what just took place in Israel. He has empowered Iran financially as well as through his sheer incompetence. The world was a safer place with in the White House. Trump 2024!!!
Biden gave them $80B worth of the best military equipment in the world during his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Biden has deliberately made the enemies of the free world stronger. Bring back Trump.

President Trump is spot on
The world would be at PEACE if was still in the White House! We want him back!
"When Donald Trump was in the White House, his Administration brokered historic Middle Eastern peace deals and brought stability to the world. The Biden Administration has brought nothing but chaos and destruction because of their weakness and incompetence."
Rigged elections have consequences
We can choose peace through strength OR chaos through weakness. We have one last chance to get this right. November 2024 can’t come soon enough.
