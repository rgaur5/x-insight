"The first ingredient of any firework is the ancient explosive black powder, made by 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal and 10% sulfur. Once lit with a fuse or spark, the sulfur melts first at 112.8°C. 

The sulfur flows over the potassium nitrate and charcoal, which then burn. This combustion reaction quickly produces a large amount of energy and gas – in other words, an explosion.

But the colors of the fireworks are determined by the elements used.

There are a number of different elements that, when added to a firework and heated, release different wavelengths of light that appear as different colors: 

- Strontium makes red. 
- Calcium produces orange. 
- Sodium releases a yellow color.
- Barium burns green.
- Copper is blue.",1

"The Arcade in Cleveland, Ohio, is a stunning architectural gem built in 1890. As a historic landmark, it was the first indoor shopping center in America.

Designed by John Eisenmann and George H. Smith, The Arcade was financed by some of Cleveland's most prominent businessmen of the time, including John D. Rockefeller, Steven V. Harkness, Louis Severance, Charles Brush, and Marcus Hanna. 

The design of the building was inspired by the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy, and it quickly became one of downtown Cleveland's most popular destinations.

The Arcade consists of two nine-story buildings joined by a five-story arcade with a glass skylight spanning over 300 feet. The structure underwent a $60-million renovation in 2001, restoring it to its former glory and ensuring that it remains a beautiful and functional part of the city.

In addition to its architectural significance, The Arcade has played a crucial role in the social fabric of Cleveland. It has been the setting for countless events, marriage proposals, and celebrations. The Arcade is more than just a building; it's a cultural icon that represents the city's history and tradition.

Today, The Arcade is a place that captures the imagination and invites exploration, a space that feels both intimate and grand.",1

"For reasons explained at length in my book & briefly in this new animated video, the world order is changing in  ways that haven't happened in our lifetime before but have happened many times in history and I want to I convey that picture to you. piped.video/xguam0TKMw8 (1/3)",1
"So I certainly don’t want to dissuade you from going after whatever you want. At the same time, I urge you to reflect on whether what you are going after is consistent with your nature. Whatever your nature is, there are many paths that will suit you, so don’t fixate on just one. Should a particular path close, all you have to do is find another good one consistent with what you’re like.

But most people lack the courage to confront their own weaknesses and make the hard choices that this process requires. Ultimately, it comes down to the following five decisions:

1. Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.
2. Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals.
3. Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones.
4. Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress.
5. Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.

Just visit tisbest.org/ and input the code REDEFINEGIFTING at checkout (and make sure to read the terms and conditions below).

In addition, along with some of my charitable friends, I will again be giving away 20,000 $50 TisBest charity gift cards for free, no strings attached, that anyone can claim to donate to their favorite charities. We've done this every year for the last three years and the cards are a big hit, both for people to use on their favorite charity or to give as a gift to someone else in their lives. Stay tuned on social media for an announcement for when the cards are available.

"Everyone who thinks the world could just stop using fossil fuels on the snap of a finger should have a look at this chart. More than 80% of the world's energy supply presently comes from oil, gas, and coal, and that number has barely changed in the past decade. 
Of course we will  eventually phase out fossil fuels, simply because the supply is finite. No matter how hard you dig, there's only so much of the stuff. 

But at present, the life of pretty much everyone on this planet depends in one way or another on fossil fuels. In case you live in a fancy new ""zero emissions"" house, well, first of all congrats on being in the 0.001% of the world population who can afford that, and second, try to figure out how many of the supply chains for building that house would break down without fossil fuels.

If we were to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow without also subsidizing fossil fuels, much of the world economy would collapse because most of the key industries would go bankrupt basically overnight. (I think we should still put a price on carbon because it's the right default, but then we'll need to find a way to ease the transition.)

This is why it's become so hard to solve this problem. It would have been easy enough 50 years ago to put a price on carbon dioxide, switch to nuclear, and with further improvements in solar to more of that. But we've missed that bus. 

I want to emphasize again because people keep misunderstanding this, I am not a fan of fossil fuels. If it were up to me, I'd plaster the world with nuclear power plants tomorrow and would take great pleasure in seeing oil companies falter and die. I am merely saying this is a difficult problem to solve, and the reason it's difficult is not technological, it's mostly economical. 

That said, let me stress again that I think the extensions of the electric grid necessary to support the transition to renewables are an underappreciated problem. Without the grid, nothing else is going to work.",1

"Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today.

Let us first say thank you to all the incredible people who we have worked with at OpenAI, our customers, our investors, and all of those who have been reaching out.

We too are still trying to figure out exactly what happened. Here is what we know:

- Last night, Sam got a text from Ilya asking to talk at noon Friday. Sam joined a Google Meet and the whole board, except Greg, was there. Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.

- At 12:19pm, Greg got a text from Ilya asking for a quick call. At 12:23pm, Ilya sent a Google Meet link. Greg was told that he was being removed from the board (but was vital to the company and would retain his role) and that Sam had been fired. Around the same time, OpenAI published a blog post.

- As far as we know, the management team was made aware of this shortly after, other than Mira who found out the night prior.

The outpouring of support has been really nice; thank you, but please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine. Greater things coming soon.",1

While it is important to be clear to people about what they are doing well, it is even more important to point out their weaknesses and have them reflect on them.

"Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists. They are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them. They create process- flow diagrams to show how the machine works and to evaluate its design. They build metrics to light up how well each of the individual parts of the machine (most importantly, the people) and the machine as a whole are working. And they tinker constantly with its designs and its people to make both better.

They don't do this randomly. They do it systematically, always keeping the cause-and-effect relationships in mind. And while they care deeply about the people involved, they cannot allow their feelings for them or their desire to spare them discomfort to stand in the way of the machine's constant improvement. To do otherwise wouldn't be good for either the individuals on the team or the team that the individuals are a part of.

Of course, the higher up you are in an organization, the more important vision and creativity become, but you still must have the skills required to manage/orchestrate well. Some young entrepreneurs start with the vision and creativity and then develop their management skills as they scale their companies; others start with management skills and develop vision as they climb the ladder. But like great musicians, all great managers have both creativity and technical skills. And no manager at any level can expect to succeed without the skill set of an organizational engineer. #principleoftheday",1

"The SVB, FTX, and OpenAI debacles have proven that boards are underrated.  Here are some things I’ve learned about building boards from @HubSpot that I hope might help other founders.

1. VC’s “can be” excellent board members.  Yes, they are self-interested, but their interests very likely align with the founders’ interests.  They are on several other boards so have legit experience in the job.  …Btw, if @JoshuaKushner and @VKhosla were on OpenAI’s board, I can’t imagine @Sama getting fired like that.
2. HubSpot’s Series A and B investors had board seats.  Both of them were both former CEO’s and their mentorship of me as a first time CEO was exceptionally helpful.  …Try to find vc’s who have been operators, if you can.  
3.  Good independent board members are worth their weight in gold.  Gail Goodman was our first.  She taught us a lot about scaling a business in those board meetings.  She also would tamper the vc’s in the board meetings if they got too aggressive with me.
4.  Don’t hire “press release independent board members.”  Don’t hire former politicians, former secretaries of _____, movie stars, or athletes.  …Elizabeth Holmes fell into this tempting trap.
5.  Avoid hiring independents who have only worked at XYZ giant company — they won’t understand the mountain you are trying to climb after spending their whole career on top of that mountain.  
6.  Given what we’ve all seen with OpenAI, it’s obvious, but you want independent board members with experience.  I might be wrong, but if Reid Hoffman were still on their board, I can’t imagine it would have shaken out this way.  Sometimes a lack of experience can be overcome with raw brains and first principled thinking in a senior hire, but not when hiring an independent board member.
7.  Build a good board and don’t worry about “retaining control.”  They “should” have the right to fire you.  That accountability is healthy for you and your company.  Trust me, the last thing “an experienced” set of board members wants to do is fire the ceo/founder and if they do, it will be after lots of feedback over a long period of time.  …If they fire you, in a very very high percentage of cases, it was probably the right thing for your company. 
8.  Board members should act like grandparents, not parents.  If they act like parents, they are too involved.  
9.  Every year, you should run an anonymous 360 review of each board member (including yourself).  That feedback should be delivered by you and your expectation should be that they work on the feedback they got, even the vc’s.  Feedback is the breakfast of champions.
10.  As the ceo/chairperson of your board, you “can” replace a board member.  We had one of our vc board members replaced by a different partner from that same fund who was a better fit.  Be careful when doing this, though.
11. You should replace independents when your company outgrows them.  They should see it coming through the 360 reviews.

Sam Bankman Fried and Elizabeth Holmes would have likely been fired if they had a proper board, but wouldn’t be in prison.

Sam Altman would have avoided this major headache if he had a proper board.

"Jeff Bezos on why humans are not truth seekers and how he overcomes the problem it creates at Amazon:

We humans are not really truth seeking animals. We are social animals.

And take you back in time 10,000 years, and you're in a small village. If you go along to get along, you can survive, you can procreate.

If you're the village truth teller, you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night truths are often, they don't want to be heard because important truths can be uncomfortable. They can be awkward. They can be exhausting, impolite, yes, challenging. They can make people defensive, even if that's not the intent. 

But any high performing organization, whether it's a sports team, a business, a political organization, activist group, I don't care what it is. Any high performing organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth telling.

The solution:

You want to set up your culture so that the most junior person can overrule the most senior person if they have data.

There are little things you can do. So, for example, in every meeting that I attend, I always speak last. And I know from experience that if I speak first, even very strong willed, highly intelligent, high judgment participants in that meeting will wonder, well, if Jeff thinks that I came in this meeting thinking one thing, but maybe I'm not right. And so you can do little things, like, if you're the most senior person in the room, go last, let everybody else go first.

In fact, ideally, try to have the most senior person go first, and the second try to go in order of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion in a kind of unfiltered way, because we really do. We actually literally change our opinions if somebody who you really respect says something makes you change your mind a little.

How biases may distort the truth:

Even, by the way, a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches. They turn out to be based on anecdotes. They're intuition based. And sometimes you don't even have strong data, but you may know the person well enough to trust their judgment. You may feel yourself leaning in.

It may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have, and then you may be able to say something about that feels right. Let's go collect some data on that. Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right. But for now, let's not disregard it because it feels right. You can also fight inherent bias.

There's an optimism bias, like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data and one of them is happy and one of them is unhappy, it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion that the happy interpretation is right. You may want to sort of compensate for that human bias of looking for trying to find the silver lining and say, look, that might be good, but I'm going to go with it's bad for now until we're sure.

"Everyone fails. Anyone you see succeeding is only succeeding at the things you're paying attention to--I guarantee they are also failing at lots of other things.

People who are just succeeding must not be pushing their limits. Of course the worst are those who fail and don't recognize it and don't change. #principleoftheday",1
"In jazz, there's no script: You have to figure things out as you go along. Sometimes you need to sit back and let others drive things; other times, you blare it out yourself.

All great creative collaboration should feel the same way. Combining your different skills like different instruments, improvising creatively, and at the same time subordinating yourself to the goals of the group leads to playing great music together.

For example, a friend of mine dove into a swimming pool, hit his head, and became a quadriplegic. But he approached his situation well and became as happy as anybody else, because there are many paths to happiness.

My point is simply this: Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control. Psychologists call this having an “internal locus of control,” and studies consistently show that people who have it outperform those who don’t.

So don’t worry about whether you like your situation or not. Life doesn’t give a damn about what you like. It’s up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it and then find the courage to carry it through. #principleoftheday",1
"Many of you have asked about how to understand yourself better and how to use that to become more successful, so I'm sharing a list of principles that have helped me over the years. #principleoftheday",1
"You must be willing to do things in the unique ways you think are best-- and to open-mindedly reflect on the feedback that comes inevitably as a result of being that way.

Learning to be radically transparent is like learning to speak in public: While it's initially awkward, the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it. This has been true for me. For example, I still instinctively find being as radically transparent in the ways that I am in this book uncomfortable because I am exposing personal material to the public that will attract attention and criticism. Yet I am doing it because I've learned that it's best, and I wouldn't feel good about myself if I let my fears stand in the way. In other words, I have experienced the positive effects of radical transparency for so long that it's now uncomfortable for me not to be that way.

Besides giving me the freedom to be me, it has allowed me to understand others and for them to understand me, which is much more efficient and much more enjoyable than not having this understanding. Imagine how many fewer misunderstandings we would have and how much more efficient the world would be--and how much closer we all would be to knowing what's true--if instead of hiding what they think, people shared it openly. I'm not talking about everyone's very personal inner secrets; I'm talking about people's opinions of each other and of how the world works. As you'll see, I've learned firsthand how powerful this kind of radical truth and transparency is in improving my decision making and my relationships. So whenever I'm faced with the choice, my instinct is to be transparent. I practice it as a discipline and I recommend you do the same. #principleoftheday",1
"Mental pain often comes from being too attached to an idea when a person or an event comes along to challenge it. This is especially true when what is being pointed out to you involves a weakness on your part. This kind of mental pain is a clue that you are potentially wrong and that you need to think about the question in a quality way. To do this, first calm yourself down. This can be difficult: You will probably feel your amygdala kicking in through a tightening in your head, tension in your body, or an emerging sense of annoyance, anger, or irritability. Note these feelings when they arise in you. By being aware of such signals of closed-mindedness, you can use them as cues to control your behavior and guide yourself toward open-mindedness. Doing this regularly will strengthen your ability to keep your ""higher-level you"" in control. The more you do it, the stronger you will become.

I want to help you discover good principles that suit you and write them down. While that might sound like a lot or like you have a lot to do to develop great principles, that’s not true at all. All you need to do is start journaling and see what comes from it. 

This is one of the principles I wrote through this process.

1. Weird teenage hobbies - Teenage years are the hardest time to go against social pressures. If they can go against the crowd as a teenager, they can go against the crowd as an adult.

2. Energy distortion field - If you meet with them when you're tired and defeated, you leave the room ready to run a marathon on a treadmill with max incline. Low agency people do the opposite.

3. Golden question - If you're in a 3rd world prison cell and had to call someone to get you out, who would you call? That's the highest agency person you know.

4. You can never guess their opinions - The boxer that writes poetry. The advertiser obsessed with the history of war. The beauty queen who reads Nietzsche. If their beliefs don't line up with their stereotypes, they've exercised agency.

5. Immigrant mentality - If they've moved from their hometown, that's a good sign. If they've moved from their home country, that's an even greater sign.

It takes agency to spot you're in the wrong place, resourcefulness to operationalise a move and a growth mindset to start from zero in a new location.

6. They send you niche content - Low agency people look at the social engagement of content before deeming its quality. High agency people just look at the content. They spot upcoming trends very early.

7. Mean to your face but nice behind your back - The social incentives are to be nice to people's faces and gossip behind their backs. To do the opposite requires agency because they're swimming against the social tide.",1

"Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change. Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result. Being radically open-minded enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can’t be any misunderstandings. The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself— and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feedback.

"It is instinctually that way, which is why most of us feel the pull of it-- in other words, we instinctively want to get better at things and have created and evolved technology to help us. History has shown that all species will either go extinct or evolve into other species, though with our limited time window that is hard for us to see. But we do know that what we call mankind was simply the result of DNA evolving into a new form about two hundred thousand years ago, and we know that mankind will certainly either go extinct or evolve into a higher state. I personally believe there is a good chance man will begin to evolve at an accelerating pace with the help of man-made technologies that can analyze vast amounts of data and ""think"" faster and better than we can. I wonder how many centuries it will take for us to evolve into a higher-level species that will be much closer to omniscience than we are now--if we don't destroy ourselves first.

One of the great marvels of nature is how the whole system, which is full of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest and without understanding or guiding what's going on, can create a beautifully operating and evolving whole. While I'm not an expert at this, it seems that it's because evolution has produced a) incentives and interactions that lead to individuals pursuing their own interests and resulting in the advancement of the whole, b) the natural selection process, and c) rapid experimentation and adaptation. #principleoftheday",1

"I wrote a lot about the people I call ""shapers"" in my book Principles: Life & Work. I use the word to mean someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts of others. Shapers get both the big picture and the details right. To me, it seems that Shaper = Visionary + Practical Thinker + Determined.

I've found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others' weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.

People wired with enough of these ways of thinking that they can operate in the world as shapers are very rare. But they could never succeed without working with others who are more naturally suited for other things and whose ways of thinking and acting are also essential.

Knowing how one is wired is a necessary first step on any life journey. It doesn't matter what you do with your life, as long as you are doing what is consistent with your nature and your aspirations. Having spent time with some of the richest, most powerful, most admired people in the world, as well as some of the poorest, most disadvantaged people in the most obscure corners of the globe, I can assure you that, beyond a basic level, there is no correlation between happiness levels and conventional markers of success. A carpenter who derives his deepest satisfaction from working with wood can easily have a life as good or better than the president of the United States. If you've learned anything from Principles: Life & Work I hope it's that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and everyone has an important role to play in life. Nature made everything and everyone for a purpose. The courage that's needed the most isn't the kind that drives you to prevail over others, but the kind that allows you to be true to your truest self, no matter what other people want you to be. #principleoftheday",1
"I am going to share with you conversations that I had with several remarkably successful people about principles for success piped.video/IGvQ1-TUGz4. Since I released my book Principles: Life & Work, I have been contacted by several extraordinarily successful people who want to brainstorm about my and their principles for success which it turns out are almost identical across domains -  sports, music, entrepreneurship, philanthropy, geopolitics, etc.  I asked them if I could record these so that I can pass them along to you because I want you to have the best principles for success from the most successful people. 
 
I am now excited for you to hear my conversation with Bill Belichick who, having just earned his 300th career win, is unquestionably one of the greatest football coaches of all time.  After he read Principles: Life and Work, he called me and said, “Mine are remarkably similar. Can we talk?”  I, of course, was excited to have that conversation and wanted to share it so that many people could benefit from it.  He agreed.  It’s a very interesting conversation about how to build winning teams.  Our conversation about how failure is the most valuable part of the path to achieving great success is especially interesting as this season has been a challenging one so far. After sharing my conversation with Bill, I will share my conversation with @DeepakChopra about principles for dealing with life and death in the best possible way.  I think you will find these interesting and valuable. 

My conversation with Bill was edited down to a 45-minute piece, which I also broke up into short clips that I will pass along separately. The full conversation is now available on YouTube.  Please give me feedback after you view it. And, Bill, congratulations on 300 wins!",1
"Having power is good because power will win out over agreements, rules, and laws all the time. When push comes to shove, those who have the power to either enforce their interpretation of the rules and laws or to overturn them will get what they want. It is important to respect power because it’s not smart to fight a war that one is going to lose; it is preferable to negotiate the best settlement possible. It is also important to use power wisely. Using power wisely doesn’t necessarily mean forcing others to give you what you want—i.e., bullying them. It includes the recognition that generosity and trust are powerful forces for producing win-win relationships, which are fabulously more rewarding than lose-lose relationships. #principleoftheday",1
"It seems to me that the personal evolutionary process takes place in five distinct steps. If you can do those five things well, you will almost certainly be successful. 

Together, these five steps make up a loop, like the one here. #principleoftheday",1
"Seek the advice of the most believable people you can find. If you don't know how to judge who the most believable people are, seek the advice of others about how to do that, such as people who have already chosen such believable people. By questioning experts individually and encouraging them to have thoughtful disagreement with each other that I can listen to and ask questions about, I both raise my probability of being right and become much better educated. This is most true when the experts disagree with me or with each other. Smart people who can thoughtfully disagree are the greatest teachers, far better than a professor assigned to stand in front of a board and lecture at you. The knowledge I acquire usually leads to principles that I develop and refine for similar cases that arise in the future.

In some cases in which the subjects are just too complex for me to understand in the time required, I will turn over the decision making to knowledgeable others who are more believable than me, but I still want to listen in on their thoughtful disagreement. I find that most people don’t do that—they prefer to make their own decisions, even when they’re not qualified to make the kinds of judgments required. In doing so, they’re giving in to their lower-level selves. #principleoftheday",1
"I practice Transcendental Meditation and believe that it has enhanced my open-mindedness, higher-level perspective, equanimity, and creativity. It helps slow things down so that I can act calmly even in the face of chaos, just like a ninja in a street fight. I'm not saying that you have to meditate in order to develop this perspective; I'm just passing along that it has helped me and many other people and I recommend that you seriously consider exploring it. #principleoftheday",1
"There is no avoiding pain, especially if you're going after ambitious goals. Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel that kind of pain if you approach it correctly, because it is a signal that you need to find solutions so you can progress. If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving. After seeing how much more effective it is to face the painful realities that are caused by your problems, mistakes, and weaknesses, I believe you won't want to operate any other way. It's just a matter of getting in the habit of doing it.

Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you're in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that's valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.)

The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential. Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through--and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes-- is not for everyone, if it is for you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments, and it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more.

If you choose to push through this often painful process of personal evolution, you will naturally ""ascend"" to higher and higher levels. As you climb above the blizzard of things that surrounds you, you will realize that they seem bigger than they really are when you are seeing them up close; that most things in life are just ""another one of those."" The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple. #principleoftheday",1
"Over the last couple of years, we have seen Ukraine fighting an existential bloody war against Russia, and we are now probably seeing Israel in such a war. The sprouting of these hot wars is reason for serious concerns, especially since these are proxy wars that could spread. The question is will we see these bloody wars spread and/or pop up elsewhere. Notably, they have not yet happened between the major powers (i.e., China and the US aren’t directly involved), though we are seeing increased risk in leading indicators of wars such as exceptional increases in military budgets. To me, this set of conditions looks similar to 1936-37 and 1912-13 - i.e., on the brink of conflict spreading to many places. ""On the brink"" doesn’t mean ""in it"" or that we will certainly go into it, but it is certainly the case that, based on my indicators and my judgement about what is happening, the odds of war in the next 10 years have increased—I estimate from about 35% to about 50%. A hot war in another part of the world, like the ones in Ukraine and in Gaza, with the US playing a role like it is playing in the other two wars, would strain the US in classic ways that caused other past empires to become weakened by being over-extended, which would be another notable step toward a more global war.",1
"The wars that result from conflicts between major powers make it clear which side gets its way and has supremacy in subsequent matters. And then the cycle begins again.",1
"Starting today, in addition to sending out Principles of the Day for life and work, on some days I will mix in Principles of the Day for monitoring and dealing with the changing world order. I am doing this because the progression of the Big Cycle is reaching the point where watching it more closely is warranted. 

As you know, my approach for dealing with reality as it is unfolding is to study how it works and identify good principles for dealing with it. I build my understanding by studying many past cases, documenting how they worked, and then developing principles for dealing with them. Then I watch what is happening, reflecting on my frame of references from studying the past, and I use my principles and my thinking to make decisions. I also computerize my principles into decision rules and use the computer to collect the substantial amounts of data that reflects what is happening and converts that data into decisions based on my principles. 

I have found that most everything has happened repeatedly throughout history, so I view most everything as ""another one of those.” I deal each “another one of those” in the way I just described. Of course, no case is exactly the same - as the saying goes ""history rhymes"" rather than repeats itself.  

In my book Principles for Dealing With the Changing World Order I provided detailed descriptions of how the world order has repeatedly changed and I provided a lot of principles for dealing with it. I described the five big forces that make up the Big Cycle (i.e, 1. the big cycle of money/credit/debt; 2. the big cycle of internal peace and conflict; 3. the big cycle of external peace and wars; 4. big acts of nature; and 5. big technology developments) and how they typically unfold and I provide many indicators that show which stage of each of these cycles, and, in turn, which stage of the Big Cycle, we are in.  For example I describe why I believe that we are in stage 5 (on the brink of war) of the Big Cycle and what to look for to signal the slipping into stage 6 (war), which include things like ""All-out wars typically occur when existential issues (ones that are so essential to the country’s existence that people are willing to fight and die for them) are at stake and they cannot be resolved by peaceful means” and “people dying in the fighting is the marker that almost certainly signifies the progression to the next and more violent state, which will continue until the winners and losers are clearly determined.” The wars that result from these conflicts between major powers make it clear which side gets its way and has supremacy in subsequent matters.

I believe that by providing these perspectives and principles for watching the Big Cycle unfold, we can together watch how history rhymes so that we can deal with its changes better than if we didn't do this.",1
"This applies to everything: when you’re buying something, asking for advice, reading the newspaper, watching the news, etc. That is because most people (though not all people) are trying to sell you something that will help them get the things they want. If you can keep this question in mind, and get the answer to it, you will be able to see things from a higher level and make better decisions. And, if you can identify the people who are true friends or those who are truly trying to help you, especially the smart ones, you will have a much better life than if you don’t. #principleoftheday",1
"It is for those reasons that so many of the principles that will follow are about ways to avoid shooting wars.",1
"As you know, I view major developments like last weekend’s shocking and horrible events in Israel as part of an unfolding story that reflects how the world order is changing in ways that are remarkably similar to the ways it has changed many times before. That is because the most important cause-effect relationships between events remain the same. In the posts I share on social media, I put major new developments in the context of the perspective that I gained by studying history in that way and by getting as much input as I can from many smart, informed people. In this latest post, I do that for the Israel-Hamas war: linkedin.com/pulse/another-s…",1
"Leverage in an organization is not unlike leverage in the markets; you're looking for ways to achieve more with less. At Bridgewater, I typically worked at about 50:1 leverage, meaning that for every hour I spent with each person who worked for me, they spent about fifty hours working to move the project along. At our sessions, we would go over the vision and the deliverables, then they'd work on them, and then we'd review the work, and they'd move forward based on my feedback—and we'd do that over and over again. The people who worked for me typically had similar relationships with those who worked for them, though their ratios were typically between 10:1 and 20:1. I am always eager to find people who can do things nearly as well as (and ideally better than) I can so that I can maximize my output per hour. 

Technology is another great tool for providing leverage. To make training as easy to leverage as possible, document the most common questions and answers through audio, video, or written guidelines, and then assign someone to organize them and incorporate them into a manual, which is updated on a regular basis. 

Principles themselves are a form of leverage—they're a way to compound your understanding of situations so that you don't need to exert the same effort each time you encounter a problem. #principleoftheday",1

"My notes from Anna Wintour’s biography turned into maxims: 

1.  Hire talented people as found, not as needed.

2.  Taste is as rare as a unicorn. 

3.Your employees should describe you as “easy to understand.” 

4.Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are.

5.Have a sharp eye for the weaknesses of others. 

6.Combine ruthless efficiency with hyper competence. 

7.If you’re not early, you’re late. 

8.Get to the point. 

9.Emails don’t need a subject line. 

10.  A blueprint for building power in media: Ads, Advice, Relationships, Money

12.Powerful people associate with valuable brands. 

13.Control all the ingredients. 

14.  Meticulously make friends with people who are the best in their field. 

15.  Nobody should know your niche as well as you. 

16.  Keep a strict professional schedule.

17.Recruit hungry young people. 

18.  Make decisions quickly. 

19.  Master the terse memo.

20.  Read voraciously.

23.  Passion, purpose, and discipline are universally admired. 

24.  Killing products is necessary to teach your team your standards.

25.  Create an environment where excellence is expected.

26.  People judge you by your performance so focus on the outcome.

27.  Be the first to leave. 

28.  Be frank about your ambition. People can’t help if they don’t know what you want. 

29.  Quality over feelings. 

30.  The founder’s job is to make sure it’s done right. 

31.  Have no qualms about being completely focused. 

32.  Talent routinely makes the mistake of being self-absorbed instead of being of service. 

33.  Stay close to the money. 

34.  Money comes naturally as a result of service. 

35.  Media can invent celebrity. 

36.  The only predictable thing about you should be your passion for your product.

42.  Build up your entire industry and you rise automatically. 

43.  Repetition is the foundation of clarity of thought.

"The iPhone came out in June 2007; Uber was founded in March 2009.

I’ve been thinking a lot about past technology revolutions and what they can teach us about our current AI revolution. If mobile offers any lesson, it’s that applications take time to develop.

ChatGPT came out 10 months ago; this means we probably still have another six to 12 months before killer apps really start to emerge.

Here’s a chart of U.S. smartphone ownership after the iPhone came out—I’ve overlaid the foundings of WhatsApp (2009), Uber (2009), Instagram (2010), and Snap (2011).

And where this chart ends—in March 2012—we were still early innings. At that point, smartphone penetration in the U.S. was hovering around 40%. In years to come, more generational startups emerged: Tinder (2012), Robinhood (2013), TikTok (2015). These apps emerged 5, 6, and 9 years after the iPhone launched, respectively.

The lesson here is that technology revolutions take time. Despite the hype for AI right now, we’re still early: while 58% of American adults have heard of ChatGPT, only 18% have used it. In recent months, ChatGPT monthly active users actually ticked down.

I expect we’ll need more vertical-specific, user-friendly LLM applications for the technology to really break through. Many of those applications are being built or dreamt up right now.",1

"Effective altruist now seems synonymous with AI doomer, but it wasn’t always that way. My own experience & why I think a lot of it is bullshit AI doomerism now:

I was an active member - went to multiple of their global summits and still mostly donate to causes that they recommend. 

I love a bargain, and EA was about evidence-based ways to reduce global poverty & suffering. You donate to deworming, vaccines, malaria nets - they save lives and it's quantifiable. Don't donate to a university, give money to save lives today.

But then it shifted to being more about about tail risks, mainly AI. I first saw it in 2015 at the global summit on Google's campus -  the most high-profile person talking about it there was @elonmusk. He read Nick Bostrom's book Superintelligence and donated $10M to the Future of Life Institute to study existential risks from AI, and made a convincing argument to the EA crowd about AI risk. A lot of folks were donating to such causes at the time - Peter Thiel was the top donor to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a similar research institute to manage existential risk.

The conversations became super weird to me but they were ""justified"" with math- global poverty is a rounding error compared to the lives that can be destroyed by AI... The math is: if humanity lasts another 50M years, & current trends hold, the total number of humans who will ever live is 3 quadrillion. The number of future humans who will never exist if humans go extinct is so great that reducing the risk of extinction by 0.00000000000000001% can be expected to save 100 billion more lives than, preventing the genocide of 1 billion people. With this math, any tail risk extinction level event trumps anything actually happening in the world today. 

One problem with this argument, of course, is that you can defend anything with an X risk that would wipe out the planet, but we actually have no idea if the destruction percentage is anywhere near accurate. We have no idea if the odds of AI doom are 0.00000000000000001% or 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001% but the argument always had some random precision that made no sense. It's like the folks who tell you they'll have a $10B business if they get 1% of the market.

The other big problem is that they also DID NOT have a discount rate. They live in a ZIRP world for real lives. They thought that people who might exist in the future should be counted equally to people who do exist today, which I took major issue with. 

These X-risk obsessives kind of took over & I realized that the thing I'd signed up for - quantitative measurement of effectiveness - isn't actually possible because it's all in measurement and outcomes, and there are a bunch of random unprecise beliefs thrown in. 

FWIW - I don't know enough to have a strong view on whether AI can take over and make humans extinct. I do think that slowing down AI research at OAI is not the solution.",1

West wind (1874, detail)

To sculpt his graceful allegory of the west wind, Gould was inspired by the opening of the transcontinental railway in 1869 which for the first time connected the lines of the Far West with the existing ones, located east of the Mississippi River.

When I can't do much to influence the outcome, I'm more risk averse. Even my best effort won't move the needle. Your ability to influence the outcome after a decision is made is a crucial thing to consider.",1

"I think more CEO’s should be zigging while others are zagging.

One coaching legend shows us how:

In the first round of April’s NFL Draft, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick traded down three spots and selected Christian Gonzalez, a cornerback who fit precisely what the team lacked on the back end. Few were surprised.

The next day, with the team’s second-round pick, he chose defensive lineman Keion White. It was an unexpected selection on the surface, but it’s a position where Belichick has a great history of drafting players and developing them. A few hours later, he took hybrid linebacker/safety Marte Mapu.

The initial reaction from draft experts was confusion. The Patriots were coming off a year when their offense ranked toward the bottom of the league. And their response was to spend their first three draft picks on defensive players?

But those two nights in April were the culmination of Belichick’s offseason plan, one that is looking more and more wise after his team played relatively well in nearly upsetting the mighty Philadelphia Eagles in their season opener. Put succinctly, Belichick’s plan for the 2023 Patriots was simple: zig where the others are zagging.

• With the rest of the league prizing high-flying, matchup-based offenses in an age of analytics, Belichick has set out to build a positionless defense capable of removing that advantage.
• With everyone else scorning special teams amid rule changes deemphasizing that phase of the game, Belichick has bulked up on specialists in free agency and the draft.
• With other teams using defenses with two deep safeties to take away explosive plays, Belichick has built a passing game centered around quick throws to receivers who can excel after the catch with room to run.
• With the rest of the league prioritizing small, quick defensive linemen who can rush the passer, Belichick has tried to create a bruising running game that can go right at those players instead of using the wide-zone schemes that are so popular around the league.
The next phase of Belichick’s post-Tom Brady roster construction is here, and its goal is to have an answer for each NFL trend.

The ensuing 16 games will dictate whether that plan was a success, but the early results were positive — even if the Pats did lose to the Eagles. The defense’s positionless back end gave the Eagles’ otherwise dominant passing game fits, limiting Jalen Hurts and company to 170 yards. The New England offense showed signs of life after a slow start and offered hope for the kind of varied approach that was absent a year ago.

"Just because someone is responsible for ""Human Resources,"" ""Recruiting,"" ""Legal,"" ""Programming,"" and so forth, doesn't necessarily mean they are the appropriate person to do everything associated with those functions.

"This applies both within and between departments. Dual reporting causes confusion, complicates prioritization, diminishes focus on clear goals, and muddies the lines of supervision and accountability — especially when the supervisors are in two different departments. When situations require dual reporting, managers need to be informed. Asking someone from another department to do a task without consulting with his or her manager is strictly prohibited (unless the request will take less than an hour or so). However, appointing co-heads of a department or a sub-department can work well if the managers are in sync and combine complementary and essential strengths; dual reporting in that case can work well if properly coordinated. #principleoftheday",1

"This is because 1) it is not their money and 2) it is difficult to know what the right price should be. For example, if somebody proposes a price of $125,000 for a consulting project, it is unpleasant, difficult, and confusing to figure out what the market rate is and then negotiate a better price. But the same person who's reluctant to negotiate with the consultant will bargain furiously when he is hiring someone to paint his own house.

Then you need to decide how many rooms it will have, where the doors will go, where you need windows, and so on. When designing the plan, you need to think about all of these things and connect them, but that doesn't mean that you actually need to go out and pick the hinges for the door yourself.

"In situations where you're unable to identify one excellent Responsible Party for a role (which is always best), find two or three believable people who care deeply about producing excellent results and are willing to argue with each other and escalate their disagreements if necessary.

"I constantly see people form wrong opinions and make bad decisions, even though they've made the same kinds of mistakes before--and even though they know that doing so is illogical and harmful. I used to think that they would avoid these pitfalls when they became aware of their blind spots, but typically that's not the case. Only very rarely do I hear someone recuse himself from offering an opinion because they aren't capable of forming a good one in a particular area. Don't bet on people to save themselves; proactively guardrail them or, better yet, put them in roles in which it's impossible for them to make the types of decisions they shouldn't make. #principleoftheday",1
"Even when you find people who are great clicks for your design, there will be times when you'll want to build guardrails around them. No one is perfect, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and as hard as you look, you won't always be able to find everything you want in one person. So look down on your machine and the people you choose for your roles, and think about where you might need to supplement your design by adding people or processes to ensure that each job is done excellently.

Remember, guardrailing is meant to help people who can by and large do their jobs well--it's intended to help good people perform better, not to help failing people reach the bar. If you're trying to guardrail someone who is missing the core abilities required for their job, you should probably just fire them and look for someone else who will be a better click.

A good guardrail typically takes the form of a team member whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the team member who needs to be guardrailed. A good guardrailing relationship should be firm without being overly rigid. Ideally, it should work like two people dancing--they're literally pushing against each other, but with a lot of mutual give-and-take. Of course, having someone in a job who needs to be guardrailed is not as good as having someone in a job who will naturally do the right things. Strive for that. #principleoftheday",1

"This thread below offers a view on why the media had so much difficulty with the news yesterday compared to the way online worked. It is an important perspective that I wanted to build upon.

It should not come as a surprise that the ""competitor"" to the media yesterday is also called ""open source"". OS News has all the properties of ""open source"" that we are familiar with from software. That means all the benefits.

It also means all of the negatives as viewed by incumbents. Much like proprietary software, the flagship media outlets view news gathering through the lens of proprietary source, only in this case the source generally means access to people, information, data that is not available to laypeople.

Since the post-Watergate era reporting has meant knocking on doors, cold calling, and most of all having relationships with established sources and experts on topics.

Conversely, these established sources and experts rely on these relationships to spoon out information and views in an effort to shape a narrative. This is a routine/process/game that has only become more institutionalized.

And those sources cold-called, much like people who did not have access to reusable code they were wildly mismatched with relative to the professionals. That is why so often these people inadvertently shaped a narrative that later proved to have problems.

In the past before open source, stories would run, information would be provided by ""sources close to"" whatever was happening in the world, and then that was the established narrative.

In today's world it is not just that everyone anywhere can post their thoughts, personal experiences, videos/photos, or anything that may or may not contribute. It is also that there is a community of people willing to test the veracity of that information. And then there is a community willing to compare the results of those tests and so on. It becomes essentially impossible for the news to be defined by a private conversation between a ""well-placed source"" and a reporter.

This reality extends even further to the vast array of sensors from satellite imagery to maps, witness recordings, historical information and records, and an incredible collection of data sources—many provided by the government itself. These sources provide more inputs to a wide-ranging community testing the validity of stories.

Finally add to this that often there are true experts on events that are no longer bound by organizations involved who are willing to lend their opinions.

It isn't simply the domain knowledge or access to the data, but the checks and balances, and the debate (vigorous as it is) across all those bits and pieces. And it is also the speed at which that system works. The participants are available around the clock, in every language, in every time zone. No newsroom has that no matter how big.

An example comparison is the world of securing and maintaining software systems. By now most in the industry know that security vulnerabilities are discovered and understood far more quickly outside the makers of those products than inside their own organizations. The information to identify, defend, and correct these problems—whether proprietary software or not—exceed that of the companies themselves. This promise of open-source software has held true from the early days. It is why the old school of keeping close to the vest in this space has so totally failed for vendors—this aspect of the proprietary model no longer works. It has been disruptive.

Events like yesterday clearly demonstrate just how disruptive the open-source news model is to events compared to the proprietary source model of the past. It also explains why there is a perception that news is far more opinion than it used to be—opinions can be branded and made proprietary far easier than trying to staff a team to compete with a community devoted to geoverification, for example.

Some long for the days of the 6pm newscast. This is most certainly a rose-colored view of the past. Those who recall this era remember being soothed by the packaging of the news. In hindsight, what we were watching was not a careful synthesis of fact-checked news but the opinions and interpretations of a small number of people with very limited expertise and even more limited information. It is only events like ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" and others recently that have shown the limits of this process in the face of modern information, data, and analysis. I kept asking myself yesterday how different the WMD story would have been had it happened 20 years later. How would a generation of events have unfolded?

It is easy to cry ""misinformation"" but that is not what is going on. Misinformation is when actors deliberately falsify what is going on. Sharing something and having an opinion as just a random person isn't that. It is misinformation for institutions that trade on trust and truthfulness to put forth information that has not been vetted by a community or has not used all available sources. News gathering has come far enough now to know that the news is not simply what one actor said off the record confirmed by a person down the hall from that actor. The actors themselves have to deal with open-source information and make a case that stands up to the sources available to everyone.

Journalists then were exceedingly well-intentioned and did all they could at the time and acted with integrity as much as any profession. That is no different than what commercial software used to be—it was the right way and only way to make software at the time.

Disruption has many forms. We tend to focus on specific technologies and markets and the business impact. What we witnessed yesterday was a prime example of old-school versus modern reporting in a fluid, chaotic, and difficult situation. I believe it is incredibly important to take lessons from this and to adjust our view of what is reliable at the time.",1

"Miyake events are cosmic storms that have struck our planet over the past few thousand years.
twitter.com/ExploreCosmos_/s…
They are characterized by a sharp increase in radiocarbon levels, leading to spikes in carbon 14 production and this is the scientists could identify and date their occurrence.

The first recorded Miyake event happened in the year 774, known as the Charlemagne event. 

Since then, five more events have been discovered through analysis of tree ring data and other historical records. These events are named after the scientist who discovered them, Fusa Miyake.

The five significant events five significant events that are currently known occurred in 7176 BCE, 5259 BCE, 660 BCE, 774 CE, and 993 CE.

There is strong evidence that Miyake events are caused by extreme solar particle events. and they are likely related to super-flares discovered on solar-like stars.

In 1859, a solar flare sent charged particles into Earth's atmosphere. Known as the Carrington event, the phenomenon was powerful enough to disrupt the world's telegraph lines.

Miyake events exhibit significantly greater intensity than the solar or stellar events that could have triggered the Carrington event in 1859. 

They carry an ominous promise to disrupt the future. In the face of a Carrington-level event, our modern telecommunications systems would collapse. Chaos would ensue.

If a Miyake event of the same magnitude as the one in 774 were to occur today, it would have a devastating impact on modern technology. Satellites, Internet cables, long-distance power lines, and transformers would all be at risk of damage.

"Sometimes hiring an external consultant is the best fit for your design. Doing so can get you precisely the amount of specialized expertise you need to tackle a problem. When you can outsource you don't have to worry about managing, and that's a real advantage. If a position is part-time and requires highly specialized knowledge, I would prefer to have it done by consultants or outsiders.

At the same time, you need to beware of the chronic use of consultants to do work that should be done by employees. This will cost you in the long run and erode your culture. Also make sure you are careful not to ask consultants to do things that they don't normally do. They will almost certainly revert to doing things in their usual way; their own employers will demand that. #principleoftheday",1
"Double-checking has a much higher rate of errors than double-doing, which is having two different people do the same task so that they produce two independent answers.

And because an audit is only as effective as the auditor is knowledgeable, remember that a good double-check can only be done by someone capable of double-doing. If the person double-checking the work isn't capable of doing the work himself, how could he possibly evaluate it accurately? #principleoftheday",1
"Generally, the ratio should not be more than 1:10, and preferably closer to 1:5. Of course, the appropriate ratio will vary depending on how many people your direct reports have reporting to them, the complexity of the jobs they're doing, and a manager's ability to handle several people or projects at once.

"I have found understanding how nature and evolution work helpful in a number of ways. Most importantly, it has helped me deal with my realities more effectively and make difficult choices. When I began to look at reality through the perspective of figuring out how it really works, instead of thinking things should be different, I realized that most everything that at first seemed ""bad"" to me--like rainy days, weaknesses, and even death--was because I held preconceived notions of what I personally wanted. With time, I learned that my initial reaction was because I hadn't put whatever I was reacting to in the context of the fact that reality is built to optimize for the whole rather than for me. #principleoftheday",1
"All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didn’t create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to fly or to send cell phone signals around the world came from understanding and applying the existing rules of reality—the physical laws or principles that govern the natural world.

I’ve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life. #principleoftheday",1

"Some groups naturally gravitate toward one another. That gravitational pull might be based on common goals, shared abilities and skills, workflow, physical location, and so forth. Imposing your own structure without acknowledging these magnetic pulls will likely result in inefficiency. #principleoftheday",1
"Your goals must be the right size to warrant the resources that you allocate to them. An organization might not be big enough to justify having both a sales and an analytics group, for example. Bridgewater successfully evolved from a one-cell organization, in which most people were involved in everything, to a multicellular organization because we retained our ability to focus efficiently as we grew.

Temporarily sharing or rotating resources is fine and is not the same as a merging of responsibilities. On the other hand, the efficiency of an organization decreases as the number of people and/or its complexity increases, so keep things as simple as possible. And the larger the organization, the more important are information technology management and cross-departmental communication. #principleoftheday",1
"Managers will often take the people who work in their organization as a given and try to make the organization work well with them. That's backward. Instead, they should imagine the best organization and then make sure the right people are chosen for it. Jobs should be created based on the work that needs to be done, not what people want to do or which people are available. You can always search outside to find the people who click best for a particular role. First come up with the best workflow design, then sketch it out on an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, and specify what qualities are required for each job. Only after all that is done should you choose the people to fill the slots. #principleoftheday",1
"Assign specific people to do each of these steps based on their natural inclinations.

For example, the big-picture visionary should be responsible for goal setting, the taste tester should be assigned the job of identifying and not tolerating problems, the logical detective who doesn't mind probing people should be the diagnoser, the imaginative designer should craft the plan to make the improvements, and the reliable taskmaster should make sure the plan gets executed. Of course, some people can do more than one of these things--generally people do two or three well. Virtually nobody can do them all well. A team should consist of people with all of these abilities and they should know who is responsible for which steps. #principleoftheday",1
"A few years ago, someone at Bridgewater proposed that our facilities group (the people who take care of the building and grounds, food service, office supplies, etc.) should begin to report to our head of technology because of the overlap in the two areas (computers are a facility too, they use electricity, and so on). But having the people who are responsible for janitorial services and meals report to a technology manager would be as inappropriate as having technology people report to the person taking care of facilities. These functions, even if they're considered ""facilities"" in the broadest sense, are very different, as are the respective skill sets. Similarly, at another time, we talked about putting the folks who work on client agreements under the same manager as those who do counterparty agreements. But that would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with clients are very different from the skills required to reach agreements with counterparties. It would be wrong to conflate both departments under the general heading of ""agreements,"" because each calls for specific knowledge and skills. #principleoftheday",1

"In nature, cleansing storms are big infrequent events that clear out all the overgrowth that's accumulated during good times. Forests need these storms to be healthy—without them, there would be more weak trees and a buildup of overgrowth that stifles other growth. The same is true for companies. Bad times that force cutbacks so only the strongest and most essential employees (or companies) survive are inevitable and can be great, even though they seem terrible at the time. #principleoftheday",1
"That ""working through it"" period is when you try out different processes and people, seeing what goes well or poorly, learning from the iterations, and moving toward the ideal systematic design. Even with a good future design picture in mind, it will naturally take some mistakes and learning to get to a good ""then"" state.

People frequently complain about this kind of iterative process because it tends to be true that people are happier with nothing at all than with something imperfect, even though it would be more logical to have the imperfect thing. That kind of thinking doesn't make sense, so don't let it distract you. #principleoftheday",1

"Regularly scheduled meetings add to overall efficiency by ensuring that important interactions and to-do's aren't overlooked, eliminating the need for inefficient coordination, and improving operations (because repetition leads to refinement).

"This is Nintendo's first office in Kyoto, 1889. Nintendo initially started out producing and selling Japanese playing cards. They did just that for nearly 75 years.

In 1963, Nintendo began to branch out to other types of businesses, investing money into a taxi service business, love hotels, a TV company, and an instant rice company. All these business ventures failed, and to make matters worse, after the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales had dropped drastically.

Starting in the late '60s, Nintendo pivoted to making toys. One of their employees was a maintenance engineer by the name of Gunpei Yokoi, whose job was to repair conveyor belts. During his free time, he had made extendable tongs for his amusement. Nintendo asked him to make a few prototypes and decided to market his toy as the ""Ultra Hand,"" which went on to sell more than 1 million units. The toy literally gave a hand to Nintendo and lifted it out of near financial ruin.

Yokoi was moved to product development and went on to create several other successful toys before jumping into making video games. During the early '80s, Yokoi began working with a young product developer named Shigeru Miyamoto. They were under pressure to develop a best-selling game for Nintendo and were competing against the likes of Namco's Pac-Man.

Miyamoto wanted to develop a video game that used the characters Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto but was unable to obtain a license. So he went on to create his own characters, Donkey Kong and an unnamed character. In the early development stages of Donkey Kong, the unnamed character was unable to jump, and the goal of the game was to escape a maze. Miyamoto decided to give the unnamed character the ability to jump, stating: ""If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?""

In Japan, the unnamed character eventually received the name Jumpman. However, when the video game was introduced to American audiences, the name was changed. According to legend, Nintendo in America was confronted by warehouse owner Mario Segale about unpaid rent. After a heated exchange, Nintendo assured Segale he would get his money. After the incident, Nintendo decided to rename Jumpman to Mario.",1

"Whenever I make an investment decision, I observe myself making it and think about the criteria I used. I ask myself how I would handle another one of those situations and write down my principles for doing so. Then I turn them into algorithms. I am now doing the same for management and I have gotten in the habit of doing it for all my decisions.

Algorithms are principles in action on a continuous basis. I believe that systemized, evidence-based decision making will radically improve the quality of management. Human managers process information spontaneously using poorly thought-out criteria and are unproductively affected by their emotional biases. These all lead to suboptimal decisions. Imagine what it would be like to have a machine that processes high-quality data using high-quality decision-making principles/criteria. Like the GPS in your car, it would be invaluable, whether you follow all of its suggestions or not. I believe that such tools will be essential in the future. #principleoftheday",1

"Focus on each task or case at hand and you will be stuck dealing with them one by one. Instead if you build a machine by observing what you're doing and why, extrapolating the relevant principles from the cases at hand, and systemizing that process well you will accelerate your progress towards your goal.

"Once you’ve successfully diagnosed the problems standing in the way of your achieving your goals, you need to design paths for solving them. Designs need to be based on deep and accurate understandings (which is why diagnosis is so important); for me, it’s an almost visceral process of staring at problems and using the pain they cause me to stimulate my creative thinking.

All of the details and plans must extend from a high-level visualization of what is required to solve the problem. Only when you have such a sketch can you begin to fill it in with specifics. Those specifics will be your tasks; write them down so you don’t forget them.

While the best designs are drawn from a rich understanding of actual problems, when you’re just starting out on something, you often have to design based on anticipated problems as opposed to actual ones. That’s why having systematic ways of tracking issues (the Issue Log) and what people are like (the Dot Collector) is so useful: Instead of just relying on your best guesses of what might go wrong, you can look at data from prior “at bats” for yourself and others and come to the design process with understanding rather than having to start from scratch.

The most talented designers I know are people who can visualize over time, running through different collections of people from the scale of small teams to entire organizations, accurately anticipating the kinds of results they’ll produce. They excel at design and systemization. Creativity is also important to this process, as is character, because the most important problems to design around are often the hardest, and you need to come up with original ways of addressing them and be willing to make hard choices (especially when it comes to people and who should do what). #principleoftheday",1

"How to spot non-fungible humans:

1. Hard to forget - Some people love them. Some people hate them. But nobody forgets them.

2. Unique language - Listening to them is like logging into Duolingo.

E.g. Musk-isms. Munger-isms. McGregor-isms.

The more ""isms"" they have, the more non-fungible they are.

3. Stories - The more stories you tell about a person, the more non-fungible they are.

The fewer stories you tell about a person, the more fungible they are.

4. Extinction > Funeral - When they die, it doesn't feel like a funeral. It feels like the extinction of a unique species.

5. Fingerprint - Their life looks like their fingerprint. 1 of 1. Distinctly unique to them.

6. Overton Windows - Fungible people see overton windows as reality.

Non-fungible people see overton windows as  prisons of the mind.

7. Impossible to replace - When they leave a room, a party or a business - they cannot be replaced with another human.

They open up a black hole that an infinite amount of square pegs can't fill.

"Snowflake announced earnings yesterday, echoing the strength within software companies more broadly & underscoring the shift in enterprise buyer behavior to normal after three quarters of extensive cost cuts.

“Q3 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to reach $698 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $111 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Results reflect strong execution in a broadly stabilizing macro environment.”

The resurgence of strength is a recent phenomenon.

“For 3 weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period in the past 2 years. Consumption continued to grow in the month of October…Consumption trends have improved.”

“We are seeing stability in customer expansion patterns.""

As with many other companies reporting strength in the market, AI & unstructured data workloads are fueling growth.

“I don’t even hear the words AI and budget in the same sentence.”

Unstructured data is the growth engine : 17x growth y/y suggests a small number last year, but phenomenal interest.

“Over 30% of customers use Snowflake to process unstructured data in October. Consumption of unstructured data was up 17x year-over-year.”

A surprising impact of the cost-cutting may be increased margins for SaaS providers on infrastructure as their own cost reductions manifest as margin improvements.

“Non-GAAP product gross margin of 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion.”

Microsoft is now compensating their salespeople for selling Snowflake more aggressively than in the past, perhaps as a competitive joust to Databricks. Microsoft will launch their Databricks competitor called Fabric soon.

“Yes, we actually saw quite a bit of energy coming from the Azure platform this quarter. The things that we worked on in the renewed relationship with Microsoft is really much better alignment in the field from a compensation standpoint that is just super, super important in our world. And we’re seeing the effects of that.""

Here’s another insight : Google’s cloud is more expensive for customers than others :

""One of the reasons why GCP is not as big as just so much more expensive for our customers to operate in GCP than it is in AWS and Azure. And as a result, our salespeople are really not inclined to do much in GCP.”

For startups operating within data, which tops buyers’ lists, this news further signals a stronger market in 2024.

"Think back on how the person performed in similar functions when they had ample capacity. If the same kinds of problems came up, then the problem is very likely one of capabilities. #principleoftheday",1
"Root causes are described in adjectives, not verbs, so keep asking ""why"" to get at them. Since most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not do them in a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people who have specific patterns of behavior. Of course, a normally reliable person can make the occasional error and if that's the case, then it can be forgiven, but when a problem is attributable to a person, you have to ask why they made the mistake--and you have to be as accurate in diagnosing a fault in a person as you would be if he or she were a piece of equipment.

A root cause discovery process might proceed like this:

The problem was due to bad programming.

Why was there bad programming?

Because Harry programmed it badly.

Why did Harry program it badly?

Because he wasn't well trained and because he was in a rush.

Why wasn't he well trained?

Did his manager know that he wasn't well trained and let him do the job anyway, or did he not know?

Consider how personal the questioning is. It doesn't stop at ""Because Harry programmed it badly."" You must go deeper in order to understand what about the people and/or the design led to the failure. This is difficult for both the diagnoser and the RPs, and it often results in people bringing up all kinds of irrelevant details. Be on your guard because people will often look to cover themselves by diving into the weeds. #principleoftheday",1
"It's one thing to point out a problem; it's another to have an accurate diagnosis and a quality solution. As described earlier, the litmus test for a good problem solver is 1) they are able to logically describe how to handle the problem and 2) they have successfully solved similar problems in the past. #principleoftheday",1
"Evaluate the merits of a past decision based not on what you know now but only on what you could have reasonably known at the time the decision was made. Every decision has pros and cons; you can't evaluate choices in retrospect without the appropriate context. Do this by asking yourself, ""What should a quality person have known and done in that situation?"" Also, have a deep understanding of the person who made the decision (how they think, the type of person they are, whether they learned from the situation, and so on). #principleoftheday",1

"I often hear people complaining about a particular outcome without attempting to understand the machine that caused it. In many cases, these complaints come from people who are seeing the cons of some decision but not the pros and don't know how the Responsible Party weighed them to come to a decision. Since all outcomes ultimately come from people and designs, asking yourself ""Who should do what differently?"" will point you in the direction of the kind of understanding that you need to actually change outcomes in the future (versus just chirping about them). #principleoftheday",1
"When you encounter problems, your objective is to specifically identify the root causes of those problems—the specific people or designs that caused them—and to see if these people or designs have a pattern of causing problems.

What are the most common reasons for failing to diagnose well?

The most common mistake I see people make is dealing with their problems as one-offs rather than using them to diagnose how their machine is working so that they can improve it. They move on to fix problems without getting at their root causes, which is a recipe for continued failure. A thorough and accurate diagnosis, while more time-consuming, will pay huge dividends in the future.

The second most common mistake people make is to depersonalize the diagnosis. Not connecting problems to the people who failed and not examining what it is about them that caused the failure will not lead to improvements of the individuals or the machines.

The third biggest reason for failure is to not connect what one is learning in one diagnosis to what was learned in prior ones. It is important to determine whether the root cause of a particular problem (“Harry was careless”) is part of a larger pattern (“Harry is often careless”) or not (“It’s unlike Harry to be careless”). #principleoftheday",1
"There are three steps to doing this well: First, note the problem; then determine who the RPs to raise it to are; and finally decide when the right time to discuss it is. In other words: what, who, when. Then follow through. #principleoftheday",1
"Unidentified problems are the worst; identified problems without planned solutions are better, but worse for morale; identified problems with a good planned solution are better still; and solved problems are best. It's really important to know which category a problem belongs to. The metrics you use to track the progress of your solution should be so clear and intuitive that they are obvious extensions of the plan. #principleoftheday",1
"Things don't just happen by themselves—they happen because specific people did or didn't do specific things. Don't undermine personal accountability with vagueness. Instead of the passive generalization or the royal ""we,"" attribute specific actions to specific people: ""Harry didn't handle this well."" Also avoid ""We should..."" or ""We are..."" and so on. Since individuals are the most important building blocks of any organization and since individuals are responsible for the ways things are done, mistakes must be connected to those individuals by name. Someone created the procedure that went wrong or made the faulty decision. Glossing over that can only slow progress toward improvement. #principleoftheday",1

3. Inversion - Look at the problem at hand from the endpoint instead of the starting point.

Don't ask: ""What do I need to do?""
Ask: ""What must I avoid?""

4. Opportunity Costs - Think about the costs that arise because you decide in favor of one option and thus against every other option.

5. Randomness - Keep in mind that there aren't always cause-effect relationships.

Lots of stuff is random.

6. Leverage - “Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes

7. Margin of Safety - Assume that your assumptions can be wrong and plan with a safety margin.

8. Occam's Razor - Always choose the less complex explanation/option.

""Never multiply unnecessarily.""

9. Law of Diminishing Returns - Up to a certain point, additional units offer more value.

But there's a turning point where additional units offer less and less value and costs rise.

10. Niches - Specializing is an effective way to success. Use it and choose a niche where you become an expert.

"Do pilots sleep in flight?

This is the process whereby pilots may take short periods of sleep (naps), while temporarily relieved of operational duties in accordance with carefully prescribed 'controlled rest' procedures, when part of a two-person operating crew of an in-flight aeroplane.

Controlled rest allows one pilot at a time to get up to 45 minutes of sleep during periods of low workload (in the cruise). This is to promote a higher level of alertness levels during periods of high workload, for example the descent, approach and landing.

The principle of controlled rest is to allow the pilots to boost alertness and energy. It’s the equivalent of a “power nap”. Ideally controlled rest should be between around 10 – 20 minutes as this limits you to the lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleeps between 30 and 60 minutes can result in sleep inertia when you wake up, which will leave you feeling groggy similar to a hangover.",1

The iconic photo captured a surreal blend of thrill and nature's dramatic display.

Hobson and his friends, Robert, Ralph, and Dave, had been camping and water skiing in the area, unaware of the volcanic eruption happening nearby. They were camping in a location with no view of the mountain, so when they went out for their morning ski and saw the eruption, they stopped the boat and sat there staring for a while.

After that, they moved their camp out on the beach in view of the mountain and spent the day there skiing and watching the eruption. On their way home, there was not a soul around. The area where they had been camping and water skiing was restricted after the eruption.",1

We got the licenses, hired the compliance and legal teams, and made it clear our brand was about trust with our customers and following the rules. We wanted to increase transparency and raise the bar on trust, so we became a public company in 2021.

This meant we couldn't always move as quickly as others. It's more difficult and expensive to take a compliant approach. You can't launch every product that customers want when it’s illegal. But it's the right approach because we believe in rule of law.

Today's news reinforces that doing it the hard way was the right decision. We now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry. We took a lot of arrows operating here in the U.S. due to the lack of regulatory clarity, and my hope is that today's news serves as a catalyst to finally achieve that. Americans should not have to go to offshore unregulated exchanges to benefit from this technology. This industry should be built right here in America, in a compliant way, under U.S. law. We're going to stay here in the U.S. because we believe in economic freedom and that the U.S. democratic system will eventually get this right.

Decentralization and crypto is a powerful tool to update the financial system and build a global economy with more economic freedom. We're just getting started 🚀",1

At @monzo, we had an event-driven data architecture that allowed us to assign cost or revenue to every action a customer might take.

Contact customer service for 4 mins 45 seconds? That's £3.11 of cost. 

£10,000 sitting in an investment account - 4 pence of revenue every day. 

Big buckets of cost like AWS were spread more-or-less uniformly across customers. 

This then allowed us to calculate profit-and-loss for every single customer, across all 8 million customers. 

We could also roll it up into cohorts - show me the bottom 10% of loss-making customers - and dig into what what making them unprofitable. 

Or show me the profitability of customers aged in their 20s vs 30s vs 40s.  

Or show me profitability of customers who signed up via a Facebook Ad vs a Google Ad.

When Steve called on Gates he kept things simple. 

He explained that he would be willing to drop the patent litigation, but for a price.

he also wanted his rival to publicly, and financially, make clear that this was an endorsement of Apple's new direction by purchasing $150 million in nonvoting shares. 

""It was classic,"" remembers Gates. ""I'd been negotiating this deal with Amelio, and Gil wanted six things, most of which were not important. 

Gil was complicated, and I'd be calling him on the phone, faxing him stuff over the holidays. 

And then when Steve comes in, he looks at the deal and says, 

'Here are the two things I want, and here's what you clearly want from us.'

"Q: Does my startup need a growth team?

Mark Zuckerberg has said that one of the best things Facebook did was invent the idea of a growth team.

In the clip below, he elaborates on this further:

“Making it so that we could grow faster was the most important product feature we ended up building for Facebook. The traditional approach to growing and marketing is you have a communications group or marketing team and you buy ads. Sometimes there’s a place for that.. But if you’re actually trying to grow a product, the best levers for doing that are often within the product itself.”

He continues:

“There’s no magic in the group we’ve built here that other people can’t replicate. It’s just being very rigorous with data and investing in data infrastructure so that you can process different experiments and learn from what customer behavior is telling you.”

He cites Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as an example of a critical product growth lever.

The key point here is that the best levers for growth are often within your product itself. Facebook’s growth team had a simple framework for growth focused on acquisition, activation, engagement, and virality. They then used this framework to prioritize design experiments and build products. Quickly iterating through these experiments and rigorously measuring what was working (and trying to understand why it was working), helped put the platform on the path to billions of users.

In terms of whether your startup needs a growth team though, the answer is probably not yet. Not because the function isn’t important, but because the whole startup should be the growth team. As Alex Schultz is CMO and VP of Analytics at Facebook puts it:

“If you’re a startup, you shouldn’t have a growth team. The whole company should be the growth team, and the CEO should be the head of growth.”",1

"Almost done w the new Elon Musk biography and here’s my review:

- first half of the book was great, the second part not so much (more on that shortly)
- lots about his childhood, his pre-silicon valley life, his family situation etc, which are interesting
- dispels a lot of dumb rumors: no, he wasn’t already rich, the govt didn’t fund Tesla, etc
- the inside look at early spaceX and tesla we’re both interesting, before many of us were tracking the two companies
- interesting to hear about personal habits (particularly gaming), why he chooses to go hardcore and sleep in the office etc
- the way elon picks his goals are interesting - obv very obsessed with very big missions, which we could all aspire to
- you get a good look at what makes him effective, particularly working around the natural bureaucracy that seeps into companies. And connecting w young engineers and being meritocratic in promoting them

My main complaint is that the early parts of the book have, say, one chapter about PayPal. But now I’m like 5 or 6 chapters into the twitter/X saga and seems kind of undifferentiated

The author is so skeptical about how twitter/X will turn out when just a few chapters ago, he discusses how everyone was so skeptical on tesla/spaceX - and of course they were all wrong. Easy to believe when things are already working

Worth a read but maybe just the first half 😂",1

"Social is VR's killer app
Similar to how social was the killer app of previous computing platforms, we believe social is the killer app of ARVR.

If you’ve played in Social VR, you’ve probably noticed one thing - it’s a kid’s world. These kids do nearly anything but play the actual game - they socialize, conspire, create, make, explore. It’s almost as if the game is a scaffold for other games, like a playground. 

At a16z, we’ve backed this youth-driven VR playground for the past two years. We call it “VR Recess”, and we’re looking for more opportunities now. Here’s why:

1. Social VR is now the primary use-case of VR
 - June 2019: 1/16 top games were F2P Social VR
 - September 2023: 3 of the top 4 VR apps, 7 of the top 13 are F2P Social.

2. Teens have the strongest VR retention
From Oculus insights to our own investments - Teens in VR have about 2x better long term retention than adults.

3. Social apps have the highest proportion of teenage users
 - Kids are more willing to interact with and make new friends online
 - Kids have less discretionary income than adults. Free is a big deal when you’re living off an allowance.

4. Teens are a growing percent of the VR user base
 - Teens have higher retention. As adults churn, teens stay active.
 - Teens have higher referral rates.
 - Quest + Quest 2 lowered the all-in cost + effective weight. Better for cash-strapped kids with weaker necks. 
 - Kids have more plastic brains and thus get less motion sick than adults whose brains expect natural 3d imagery.

5. There is a vast *undersupply* of content going after this audience.
There are only ~10 f2p social games on the Quest store. All of them are in the top 30 most played.

6. Of the few who build in Social VR, few truly understand their audience.
Of those 10, only Gorilla Tag truly *gets* its audience. It embraces its younger audience with youthful playfulness, low stakes, and a high, visible skill ceiling.

7. Despite less discretionary income, Teens still have the highest CLV
Teens are low on cash but high on retention. This leads to lower short term ARPUs but higher longer term CLVs. 

8. Games played in formative years tend to be games played forever
 - Music paralysis is when people stop seeking out new music once they’re 31 years old. The same likely applies to games.
 - Old School Runescape and WoW Classic are played more than their current counterparts.
 - Top grossing IPs (Pokemon, Disney Princess, Winney the Pooh) all target younger audiences.

9. The future of synchronous social networks are games

10. Social networks start young and age up. Social VR’s audience is very young.
 - Facebook starting with colleges
 - Roblox with Gen Alpha
 - Snapchat with High Schoolers
etc...

11. Social has been the killer use-case of all prior computing platforms
 - Email and AIM for computers
 - Texts, calls, and social networks for phones

12. VR is the next computing platform
Humans approximately have optimized for 2d information since the invention of written language ~5,000 years ago. Humans have been optimizing for the 3d world since they were arboreal creatures. We’re wired for 3D, and VR finally aligns our digital and lived experience. VR’s sense of immersion, disregard of physical limitations, and ability to defy distance are all added bonuses.

Building in Social VR?
Social VR or “VR Recess” is the present and future of consumer VR, yet few are building in this space. So if you’re interested in Social VR or building in VR at large, I’d love to chat. We also recommend you apply to a16z’s Games x Tech accelerator, Speedrun. speedrun.a16z.com/",1

Because so many people told me that it had a huge impact on their lives and that they wished they could have seen the principles applied in real-life situations, I put out this Principles in Action app. In addition to the videos of real situations with real people living by these principles, it has everything I’ve done in an easy-to-use format that is always up to date, including the complete text of my book Principles: Life & Work and the animated videos I’ve created.

"It's your responsibility to make sure communications from your people flow freely, so encourage it by giving them plenty of opportunities to speak up. Don't just expect them to provide you with regular and honest feedback – explicitly ask them for it. #principleoftheday",1
"Encourage people to bring problems to you. If everyone in your area feels responsible for the area's wellbeing and no one is afraid to speak up, you will learn about problems when they are still easy to fix and haven't caused serious damage. Stay in sync with the people who are closest to the most important functions. #principleoftheday",1
"Think of yourself as a chef and taste the soup before it goes out to the customers. Is it too salty or too bland? Managers need to do that too, or have someone in their machine do it for them, for every outcome they're responsible for. People who are delegated this task are called ""taste testers."" #principleoftheday",1
"This means comparing the outcomes that the machine is producing to your visualization of the outcomes you expected so that you can note any deviations.  #principleoftheday",1
"If you see something that seems unacceptable to you, don't assume that the fact that others also know about it and aren't screaming means it's not a problem. This is an easy trap to fall into--and a deadly one. Whenever you see badness, point it out to the Responsible Party and hold them accountable for doing something about it. Never stop saying, ""This meal stinks!"" #principleoftheday",1
"Apparently, if you throw a frog into a pot of boiling water it will jump out immediately, but if you put it in room-temperature water and gradually bring it to a boil, it will stay in the pot until it dies. Whether or not that's true of frogs, I see something similar happen to managers all the time. People have a strong tendency to slowly get used to unacceptable things that would shock them if they saw them with fresh eyes. #principleoftheday",1
"Without these things in place, you can't rely on people raising all the problems you need to hear about. #principleoftheday",1
"This is usually done by having the right people--people who will probe, who can't stand inferior work or products, and who can synthesize well--and by having good metrics. #principleoftheday",1
"That's because worrying about what can go wrong will protect you and not worrying about what will go wrong will leave you exposed. #principleoftheday",1
"On your way to your goals, you will inevitably encounter problems. To be successful you must perceive and not tolerate them. Problems are like coal thrown into a locomotive engine because burning them up—inventing and implementing solutions for them—propels us forward. Every problem you find is an opportunity to improve your machine.

For a lot of people identifying problems is difficult to do. Most people would rather celebrate all the things that are going well while sweeping problems under the rug. Those people have their priorities exactly backward, and there is little that can be more harmful to an organization. Don’t undermine your progress in pursuit of a pat on the back; celebrate finding out what is not going well so you can make it go better. Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve may make you anxious, but not thinking about them (and therefore not dealing with them) should make you even more anxious.

Having this kind of anxiety about what can go wrong is extremely useful. It is what drives one to develop systems and metrics for monitoring the outcomes your machine is producing and motivates those who manage well to constantly taste-test the outputs of the system and to look for problems in its nooks and crannies. Having that constant worry and doing the double-checking is important to maintaining quality control. Making sure that little problems don’t exist is important because, if they’re allowed to continue, they will grow into big problems.

The existence of a problem — whether from a flaw in the design of one’s machine or from one’s own or others’ inabilities—is not shameful. Acknowledging a weakness isn’t the same thing as accepting it. #principleoftheday",1
"A common mistake is accepting your own best solution when it isn’t good enough. #principleoftheday",1
"Escalating means saying you don't believe you can successfully handle a situation and that you are passing the Responsible Party job to someone else. The person you are escalating to--the person to whom you report--can then decide whether to coach you through it, take control themselves, have someone else handle it, or do something else.

It's critical that escalation not be seen as a failure but as a responsibility. All Responsible Parties will eventually face tests that they don't know whether they can handle; what's important is raising their concerns so their boss knows about the risks and both the boss and the escalating RP can get in sync about what to do about it. There is no greater failure than to fail to escalate a responsibility you cannot handle. Make sure your people are proactive; demand that they speak up when they can't meet agreed-upon deliverables or deadlines. Such communication is essential to get in sync both on the case at hand and on what the person handling it is like. #principleoftheday",1
"Before moving forward with a new plan, take the time to reflect on how the machine has been working up till now.

Sometimes people have problems putting current conditions into perspective or projecting into the future. Sometimes they forget who or what caused things to go well or poorly. By asking them to ""tell the story"" of how we got here, or by telling the story yourself, you highlight important items that were done well or poorly in relation to their consequences, draw attention to the bigger picture and the overarching goals, specify the people who are responsible for specific goals and tasks, and help achieve agreement. Being able to connect all these items at multiple levels is essential for people to understand the plan, give feedback on it, and eventually believe in it. #principleoftheday",1
"People should know the plans and designs within their departments. If you decide to diverge from an agreed-upon path, be sure to communicate your thoughts to the relevant parties and get their views so that you are all clear about the new direction. This allows people to buy into the plan or express their lack of confidence and suggest changes. It also makes clear what the goals are and who is keeping up his or her end of the bargain and who is falling short. Goals, tasks, and assigned responsibilities should be reviewed at department meetings at least once a quarter, perhaps as often as once a month. #principleoftheday",1
"A ""theoretical should"" occurs when people assume that others or themselves should be able to do something when they don't actually know whether they can (as in ""Sally should be able to do X, Y, Z""). Remember that to really accomplish things you need believable Responsible Parties who have a track record of success in the relevant area.

A similar problem occurs when people discuss how to solve a problem by saying something vague and depersonalized like ""We should do X, Y, Z."" It is important to identify who these people are by name rather than with a vague ""we,"" and to recognize that it is their responsibility to determine what should be done.

It is especially pointless for a group of people who are not responsible to say things like ""We should . . ."" to each other. Instead, those people should be speaking to the Responsible Party about what should be done. #principleoftheday",1
"People who can see the goals are usually able to synthesize too. One way to test this: If you ask a high-level question like ""How is goal XYZ going?"" a good answer will provide a synthesis up-front of how XYZ is going overall and, if needed, will support it by accounting for the tasks that were done to achieve it. People who see the tasks and lose sight of the goals will just describe the tasks that were done. #principleoftheday",1

"This occurs when a manager is pulled down to doing the tasks of a subordinate without acknowledging the problem. The sucked-down phenomenon bears some resemblance to job slip, since it involves the manager's responsibilities slipping into areas that should be left to others. But while job slipping can make sense on a temporary basis to push through to a goal, it's also generally a signal that a part of the machine is broken and needs fixing. The sucked-down phenomenon is what happens when a manager chronically fails to properly redesign an area of responsibility to keep him or herself from having to do the job that others should be capable of doing well. You can tell this problem exists when the manager focuses more on getting tasks done than on operating his or her machine. #principleoftheday",1

"People will often subconsciously gravitate toward activities they like rather than what's required. If they lose sight of their priorities, you need to redirect them. This is part of why it's important to get frequent updates from people about their progress. #principleoftheday",1
"Holding people accountable means understanding them and their circumstances well enough to assess whether they can and should do some things differently, getting in sync with them about that, and, if they can't adequately do what is required, removing them from their jobs. It is not micromanaging them, nor is it expecting them to be perfect (holding particularly overloaded people accountable for doing everything excellently is often impractical, not to mention unfair).

But people can resent being held accountable, and you don't want to have to tell them what to do all the time. Reason with them so that they understand the value of what you're doing, but never let them off the hook. #principleoftheday",1
"If you want to be followed, either for egotistical reasons or because you believe it more expedient to operate that way, you will pay a heavy price in the long run. When you are the only one thinking, the results will suffer.

Authoritarian managers don't develop their subordinates, which means those who report to them stay dependent. This hurts everyone in the long run. If you give too many orders, people will likely resent them, and when you aren't looking, defy them. The greatest influence you can have over intelligent people--and the greatest influence they will have on you--comes from constantly getting in sync about what is true and what is best so that you all want the same things. #principleoftheday",1
"Just worry about making the best decisions possible, recognizing that no matter what you do, most everyone will think you're doing something-- or many things-- wrong. It is human nature for people to want you to believe their own opinions and to get angry at you if you don't, even when they have no reason to believe that their opinions are good. So, if you're leading well, you shouldn't be surprised if people disagree with you. The important thing is for you to be logical and objective in assessing your probabilities of being right.

It is not illogical or arrogant to believe that you know better than the average person, so long as you are appropriately open-minded. In fact, it is not logical to believe that what the average person thinks is better than what you and the most insightful people around you think, because you have earned your way into your higher-than-average position and you and those insightful people are more informed than the average person. If the opposite were true, then you and the average man shouldn't have your respective jobs. In other words, if you don't have better insights than them, you shouldn't be a leader-- and if you do have better insights than them, don't worry if you are doing unpopular things.

So how should you deal with your people? Your choices are either to ignore them (which will lead to resentment and your ignorance of what they are thinking), blindly do what they want (which wouldn't be a good idea), or encourage them to bring their disagreements to the surface and work through them so openly and reasonably that everyone will recognize the relative merits of your thinking. Have the open disagreement and be happy to either win or lose the thought battles, as long as the best ideas win out. I believe that an idea meritocracy will not only produce better results than other systems but will also ensure more alignment behind appropriate yet unpopular decisions. #principleoftheday",1
"Sometimes asking questions to gain perspective can be misperceived as being weak and indecisive. Of course it's not. It's necessary in order to become wise and it is a prerequisite for being strong and decisive.

Always seek the advice of wise others and let those who are better than you take the lead. The objective is to have the best understanding to make the best possible leadership decisions. Be open-minded and assertive at the same time and get in tight sync with those who work with you, recognizing that sometimes not all or even the majority of people will agree with you. #principleoftheday",1
"I don't use the word ""leadership"" to describe what I do or what I think is good because I don't believe that what most people think of as ""good leadership"" is effective. Most people think a good leader is a strong person who engenders confidence in others and motivates them to follow him/her, with the emphasis on ""follow."" The stereotypical leader often sees questioning and disagreement as threatening and prefers people do what they're told. As an extension of this paradigm, the leader bears the main burden of decision making. But because such leaders are never as all-knowing as they try to appear, disenchantment and even anger tends to set in. That's why people who once loved their charismatic leaders often want to get rid of them.

This traditional relationship between ""leaders"" and ""followers"" is the opposite of what I believe is needed to be most effective, and being maximally effective is the most important thing a ""leader"" must do. It is more practical to be honest about one's uncertainties, mistakes, and weaknesses than to pretend they don't exist. It is also more important to have good challengers than good followers. Thoughtful discussion and disagreement is practical because it stress-tests leaders and brings what they are missing to their attention.

One thing that leaders should not do, in my opinion, is be manipulative. Sometimes leaders will use emotions to motivate people to do things that they would not do after reflecting clearly. When dealing with intelligent people in an idea meritocracy, it is essential that one always appeal to their reason rather than their base emotions.

The most effective leaders work to 1) open-mindedly seek out the best answers and 2) bring others along as part of that discovery process. That is how learning and getting in sync occurs. A truly great leader is appropriately uncertain but well equipped to deal with that uncertainty through open-minded exploration. All else being equal, I think the kind of leader who looks and acts like a skilled ninja will beat the kind of leader who looks and acts like a muscular action hero every time. #principleoftheday",1

"Happy 4th of July! God, I love this day with my family and friends savoring a classic July 4th BBQ, drinks, and camaraderie followed by all of us watching a big fireworks display.  I also can't help but wonder what principles bind us together today and have connected us from July 4, 1776 until now.    

I recently reviewed the history of the area that we now call the United States which began long before Europeans came for the treasures they could grab during the Age of Exploration and continued through the settlement of the eastern continent, the settlement of the Wild West, slavery, the Civil War, the Industrial Revolution, the two World Wars, and the booms, busts, and a lot more up until now. My independent study led me to realize that the real story of the United States is very different from the one I was taught in school—it’s much more realistic and less idealistic. Now, when I look back with a more objective eye at examples like the fight between the cowboys and Indians (e.g., at Custer’s Last Stand) and the Texans and Mexicans (at the Alamo), and I look at what has really happened throughout history between people and at how people really behave, I realize that most people just fight for what they want, that most people define good as what they want and who is on their side and bad as those people and things that are against them, and that what has shaped American civility and what binds Americans together is the governance system as laid out in the Constitution.  Without the Constitution and Americans abiding by it, only power and the powerful would rule, and we would fight for what we each want with greater ferocity until we beat each other into a barbarian state.  

Of course, the Constitution and abiding by it leaves us with a lot that we don’t like. While we individually might not like those who we collectively elect or agree with the laws that they write or the Supreme Court decisions made, the fact that we abide by the set of rules in the Constitution—which are far more powerful than any person or group of people—binds us together, and prevents us from being brutal with each other.   

As I now savor this peaceful day and look forward to the fireworks, I now can see the connection between these joys, our shared history, and the Constitution that makes it all possible. That brings me comfort. Thank God for the Constitution and our respect for it. May it continue, and continue to evolve, in the future as it has in the past.",1
"Plenty of people have threatened me over the years by saying they'd quit, bring a lawsuit, embarrass me in the press--you name it. While some people have advised me that it's easier to just make such things go away, I've found doing that is almost always shortsighted. Giving in not only compromises your values, it telegraphs that the rules of the game have changed and opens you up to more of the same. Fighting for what's right can be hard in the short term, of course. But I'm willing to take the punch. What I worry about is doing the right thing and not about what people think about me. #principleoftheday",1
"It's often said that it is neither fair nor appropriate to treat people differently. But in order to treat people appropriately you must treat them differently. That is because people and their circumstances are different. If you were a tailor you wouldn't give all of your customers the same size suit.

It is, however, important to treat people according to the same set of rules. That's why I've tried to flesh out Bridgewater's principles in enough depth that differences are accounted for. For example, if someone has worked at Bridgewater for many years, that factors into how they are treated. Likewise, while I find all dishonesty intolerable, I don't treat all acts of dishonesty and all people who are dishonest the same. #principleoftheday",1

"Thinking like an owner means making sure that your responsibilities are handled well regardless of what comes up. While you are away on vacation, it's your responsibility to make sure nothing drops. You can do that via a combination of good planning and coordination before you go and staying on top of things while you are away. This needn't take much time--it can be as little as an hour of good checking from afar and it doesn't even have to be every day, so you can typically slip it in when it's convenient. #principleoftheday",1
"It's a basic reality that if you don't experience the consequences of your actions, you'll take less ownership of them. If you are an employee, and you get a paycheck for turning up and pleasing your boss, your mind-set will inevitably be trained to this cause-effect relationship. If you are a manager, make sure you structure incentives and penalties that encourage people to take full ownership of what they do and not just coast by. This includes straightforward things such as spending money like it's their own and making sure their responsibilities aren't neglected when they're out of the office. When people recognize that their own well-being is directly connected to that of their community, the ownership relationship becomes reciprocal. #principleoftheday",1
"It's worth pulling all suspicious threads because: 1) Small negative situations can be symptomatic of serious underlying problems; 2) Resolving small differences of perception may prevent more serious divergence of views; and 3) In trying to create a culture that values excellence, constantly reinforcing the need to point out and stare at problems--no matter how small--is essential (otherwise you risk setting an example of tolerating mediocrity).

Prioritization can be a trap if it causes you to ignore the problems around you. Allowing small problems to go unnoticed and unaddressed creates the perception that it's acceptable to tolerate such things. Imagine that all your little problems are small pieces of trash you're stepping over to get to the other side of a room. Sure, what's on the other side of the room may be very important, but it won't hurt you to pick up the trash as you come to it, and by reinforcing the culture of excellence it will have positive second- and third order consequences that will reverberate across your whole organization. While you don't need to pick up every piece, you should never lose sight of the fact that you're stepping over the trash nor that it's probably not as hard as you think to pick up a piece or two as you go on your way. #principleoftheday",1
"Imagine you had to describe what a rose smells like to someone who lacks a sense of smell. No matter how accurate your explanation, it will always fall short of the actual experience. The same thing is true of differences in ways of thinking. They are like blind spots, and if you have one (which we all do), it can be challenging to see what's there. Working through these differences requires a lot of patience and open-mindedness, as well as triangulating with other people who can help fill in the picture. #principleoftheday",1
"It's important to welcome probing of yourself because no one can see themselves objectively. When you are being probed, it's essential to stay calm. Your emotional ""lower-level you"" will probably react to probing with something like, ""You're a jerk because you're against me and making me feel bad,"" whereas your thoughtful ""higher-level you"" should be thinking, ""It's wonderful that we can be completely honest like this and have such a thoughtful exchange to help assure that I'm doing things well."" Listen to your higher-level you and don't lose sight of how difficult it can be for the person doing the probing. Besides helping to make the organization and your relationship with the person who is probing you go well, working yourself through this difficult probing will build your character and your equanimity. #principleoftheday",1

"The story of Emilie du Châtelet, the scientist who feared that bearing a child at 42 would be the last thing she did. In her final year, she worked furiously on a magnum opus that would spread physics in the world. 

She was born #Today in 1706.

She was a French mathematician, physicist, and author during the Age of Enlightenment. Her crowning achievement is considered to be her translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work Principia Mathematica. However, her life was cut short due to complications from childbirth.

At the age of 42, du Châtelet became pregnant with her fourth child. Despite her fears that this might be the last thing she did, she continued to work on her translation of Newton's Principia. Sadly, her fears were realized when she died from complications related to childbirth in 1749, just a few days after the birth of her daughter.

Despite the tragic end to her life, du Châtelet's legacy as a pioneering scientist and translator has endured. Her work helped to popularize the theories of Isaac Newton and bring them more widespread acceptance in Europe. She is remembered as a groundbreaking figure in the history of science, and her story serves as a reminder of the sacrifices that many women have made in pursuit of knowledge and discovery.",1

What Is Agent AI And Why All The Excitement?",1
"Trying something new that's a bit...out there.

I'm noodling and tinkering with a new (free) hobby project called agent.ai. 

Because I (and others smarter than me) think agents are where A.I. is headed.

But, I believe in building community alongside product. (That's how HubSpot happened). It makes for a better product.

So, if you signup now for the agent.ai alpha/waitlist, you'll be the first to get access to the product.

In the meantime, I'll be posting periodically to the newsletter about what I learn and what dots of thoughts I'm collecting about A.I. (I'm a big believer that dots connect in the future in unexpected ways).

I read all comments and am open to any topics/questions/ideas you have. We are in early days.

Thanks for your support.|

"Vendr’s quarterly report on SaaS purchasing trends summarize the sentiment of the software market. Q2 was tough but Q3 is looking up.

The average sales cycle has lengthened from 32 to 44 days for net new software, a 37% increase.

Slower cycles & fewer new purchases : 19% of software purchases are net new in 2023 ; just 17% in Q3. Still about 1-in-5, but down from 30% last year.

In a challenging market where new customers are a challenge, how does a company grow? Increase price & cross-sell.

Average contract values rose 43% q/q - nearly the average over this time period.

What’s selling? BI, data integration, data science + analytics top the podium.

One last notable data point : DataDog’s ACVs are twice as high as any other vendor in the report at $220k. Salesforce, Cloudflare, & Netsuite are next with ACVs in the $100k-$120k range.

That $220k number is 3x DataDog’s current ACV & it’s driven by a remarkable push up-market & cross-sell effort detailed in their earnings report earlier this week.

Doubling down on existing customers & growing those accounts have been the dominant way to drive growth during this challenging year.",1

"Because I am a big supporter of oceanographic exploration, research, and media pertaining to both—and I founded and support @oceanx in doing these things—I have been asked many times to share my thoughts and feelings about the OceanGate  expedition. My thoughts and emotions are very mixed in ways that I will try to convey.  

By way of background, because I believe that the ocean is our greatest asset that has been terribly neglected, I am trying to improve the situation through my efforts with OceanX. That has brought me deeply into the community of those in the underwater world. I was told about the loss of contact with the OceanGate vehicle about two hours after it happened because there was some chance that one or more of OceanX's underwater vehicles could help in the search for the passengers. But given the simultaneous disappearance of all the vehicle’s systems and other indications, the consensus among the undersea community quickly became that the vehicle had had a catastrophic implosion. At that point, I felt both a deep sadness for those on the expedition and their families and great anger because I knew that the tragedy was due to reckless disregard for tried-and-true safety protocols that have made manned submersible exploration extremely safe. I knew that OceanGate had created its own experimental vehicle with materials avoided by others, decided to bypass the certification processes designed to assure safety, and chose to ignore the warnings from many experts within the submersible community. I also knew that no submersible that was operated under classification rules has experienced anything like this over the last 40 years, with millions of people having gone on many dives for many years, including dives that were much deeper than this one to the Titanic. In other words, submersible diving, and the ocean exploration that it provides, has been safer than flying on a commercial airplane or driving in a car. So the needlessness of this tragedy was shocking to me. 

At the same time, since I knew from the first day that the OceanGate craft had almost certainly imploded, as I watched the media drama play out until yesterday, I wondered how much of it was being provided as news without wanting to convey the full picture until the definitive end out of consideration for the missing people's family and friends--and how much of it was to pursue a nail-biting story to hold people's attention. In the end, I felt that it was all so tragic.",1
"Over time, you’ll hear the same verbal cues indicating that someone is thinking about something badly or failing to apply principles appropriately. Common examples of these cues include:

- The anonymous “we,” which indicates that someone is likely depersonalizing a mistake (e.g., “We should have been more careful” instead of “John should have been more careful.”)

-“I think I,” which is a marker of a self-assessment and could be a cue that someone is more confident in their own performance than is accurate (e.g., “I think I’ve been managing the project well”)

-Answering a question like, “How’s it going?” with a statement of the trend (e.g., “It’s been getting better”) vs. a crisp synthesis of whether what’s in question is adequate (e.g., “It’s below the bar.”)

-Saying something “isn’t totally true,” which often means it’s by and large true.

-“I don’t know / I could be wrong, but…” People often follow this caveat by expressing an opinion that isn’t believable, so the listener should use it as an indication to ask questions instead of accepting the view.

-Responding to a question with, “I’m not sure, but I do know that…” This often leads to the conversation being diverted into talk about what the responder claims he or she “does know” instead of what you were asking about. Don’t fall into this trap! #principleoftheday",1
"I am pleased to be able to help PM Modi as he is a man whose time has come when India’s time has also come. He and India are in an analogous position to Deng Xiaoping and China in the early 1980s--i.e., at the brink of the fastest growth rates and biggest transformations in the world. Additionally, the challenges both between and within China and the US are putting PM Modi in a unique position to influence the complexion of the world order via influencing the non-aligned world 's dealings with these two leading world powers. I believe that Modi has what it takes to have the greatest impact on the largest number of people in the world at a time that the risks of harmful impact are greater than at any time in our lifetimes.",1

"Today is Juneteenth, celebrating the complete emancipation of enslaved people in America in 1865. To me, it was an important step toward the aspiration to gain the most important thing that our country must aspire to: equal opportunity. In studying history and using quantitative indicators to measure cause-effect relationships, it is clear to me that equal opportunity creates both a) the most prosperous societies because it draws upon the broadest population base to find the most talented people and to make the highest possible percentage of the population productive and b) the most stable societies because there is the least conflict over injustices. In my opinion, providing equal opportunities to learn and work should be our society's highest priority. The key performance indicators that I maintain show that though there have been notable advances in some areas, the state of affairs has worsened as the education and wealth gaps have widened, the family unit has deteriorated, the middle class has weakened, and mental illness and harmful drug use have increased. So instead of just having this day pass by, I hope we will each take a moment to reflect on what equality signifies to us.",1

I hope you find this valuable regardless of your role or stage in life and I encourage you to look to others who study this subject or who you admire because they have done it well, rather than just look to mine.

As I see it:

-Life is a birth-to-death journey of going after goals, encountering obstacles, learning how to get around them, and in the process of gaining powers and achieving more of what one wants. It is best if your kids do this on their own with help. As your kids encounter their realities, act as mentor to help them experience and reflect on these realities well and, in the process, learn the most important principles of life that are not adequately taught in schools. Help them to think in a principled way when they face their encounters, reflecting their values about what they are going after and how to get these things through principles. By experiencing these things and reflecting on them with you rather than you telling them what to do, and by deriving joy and satisfaction from striving for goals and overcoming obstacles, they will discover what they want for themselves and develop the character and capabilities to get these things. And for God’s sake, don’t micromanage them.

-In the process of doing these things, teach your children that making painful mistakes is part of the process and invaluable for learning. Help them develop a mindset where they don’t feel bad about their mistakes and make the most of them. This is an important antidote from school and other experiences which tend to make them feel bad about the mistakes that are part of the learning process.

-Love them a lot but not so much that you smother them with it. 
Embrace tough love. Place them into tolerably difficult positions and deny them some of the things they ""want"" to give them the opportunity to struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own. 
Help them realize a good life is a good mix of enjoyment, the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles to produce achievements, and having a meaningful impact.",1

"My Top 10 Favorite DevDay Announcements

(And the ones that didn’t make the cut at the bottom)

I prioritized them based on: immediate & potential impact + interestingness (totally subjective)

#10 - Custom Models-As-A-Service
You can now work with OpenAI researchers to go deep on model building for your specific use case…it’ll just run you $2M-$3M to do so

twitter.com/saboo_shubham_/s…

This is an interesting service play for OpenAI. Also a good exercise for domain specific model building.

What I find even more interesting is the opportunity for other agencies to provide fine-tuning help as a service.

#9 - GPT-4 Fine Tuning
It’s well known that fine tuning gpt-3.5 exceeds GPT4 on some tasks. Even if the performance is the same, you get a massive drop in cost and latency.

nitter.net/GregKamradt/stat…

Fine-Tuning GPT-4 will take this further. We’ll need to reset benchmarks.

#8 - Text-To-Speech API
We already had good text to speech with ElevenLabs and Play.ht so this isn’t a big unlock. I don’t mind consolidating vendors.

Not to mention, OpenAI’s TTS is 10x cheaper than ElevenLabs.

How long do you think it’ll be till they allow custom voices?

#7 - ChatGPT Backed By GPT-4-Turbo
Love it - I use ChatGPT for ad-hoc tasks almost hourly, I’ll take the speed boost here all day long.

This isn’t a huge change, but the frequency of use puts it in my top 10

#6 - GPT-4-Turbo -  128K Token Context Length
This one’s is a bit controversial - On one hand you have the crowd that adores context length. It’s an easy metric to wrap your head around.

But we could already handle long context via chunking and chain strategies. I agree that it’s a nice addition, but a bit over hyped.

Yes you get lower latency with a single API call, but what is the performance hit?

PS: I’m currently pressure testing the 128K context limit with a “needle in a haystack” analysis. I’ll drop a random fact in the middle of a large context window to see if gpt4-128K context can pull it out.

#5 - GPT 3.5  & 4 Price Reduction (2-3x)
So GPT4 is better and it’s cheaper? I like that combo.

As the price reduces you drop the barrier to entry on a few use cases.

For example a use case I heard yesterday from @niallohiggins, if you were in the data monitoring game, passing in a bunch of logs to GPT4 was expensive.

At half the costs, you can now increase your flow of data

#4 - DALL·E 3 API
Love this one - it’s so high on my list because it’s a net new capability for millions of developers.

Get ready to see millions of photos flooding apps near you.

#3 - Assistant GPTs/API
Ok, now we get into the serious part of the list. OpenAI isn’t messing around anymore

Let’s talk about what the Assistant API actually does:

* Code interpreter API
** This means OpenAI will run a bit of code on their end, then give you the result. This is great for longer math and file transformations.
** This was only available via the UI up until now, having it via API means devs can offload a ton of hacks they did to try to get this working before

* File Retrieval
** So assistants can reference files you’ve uploaded
** OpenAI will take care of chunking, embeddings, and retrieval for you - this sounds great on paper right?
** For no-code builders this’ll be a great unlock they don’t have to worry about more
** But for devs, I predict they’ll want more control over the retrieval process then OpenAI will give them.
** Not only that, but it’s super expensive to host files with OpenAI

* Persistent threads
** This is nice and convenient, thread management per user was an annoying issue for a while

This isn't higher on my list because of plugin adoption.  I'm super excited to build with it, but I'll be more excited when I see user energy for assistant value.

#2 - ChatGPT Store
You might think this would be #1, but it was dethroned because of my uncertainty around adoption.

Yes, the demo's cool, but  haven’t seen the evidence of user-need to call this one game changing yet. If it does work, then it’s the beginning of a massive product opportunity

There are a couple facts to keep in mind:
* - Building marketplaces is extremely hard
* - Plugin adoption didn’t go well
* + Monetary incentives to build apps can drive crazy adoption

Reasons why I like the ChatGPT Store:
* Instead of “look at these 150 ChatGPT Prompts” posts on LinkedIn well now get “look at these 150 GPTs” instead. In theory the latter should provide more value
* Love the creator profiles
* With revenue sharing, not only do developers have incentive to build, but they have an immediate feedback loop to the value they’re providing to users.

The biggest use case of wrapper-apps has been “chat with your data” which is the bread and butter of these assistants

So the big question in everyone’s mind is, “Are wrappers dead?”

My quick answer is: Not yet, it’s not looking good, but they control their own fate

If you want a bellwether of where this is going, follow PDF.ai. They are about as “wrapper” as it gets.

Yet to beat OpenAI, they’ll need to provide ancillary services, build quality products around their wrapper, and better meet the needs of their customers.

The key here is to position yourself so you’re not competing with OpenAI. Play a different game.

#1 - GPT-4V API
Finally, my favorite announcement from Monday.

Lowering latency and cost are nice, but how often do you have a new modality at your service?

After GPT-4V came out in the UI I wrote a big post on how people were using it

nitter.net/GregKamradt/stat…

They were all one shot examples: you give GPT-4 a single photo and it gives you a response.

But now that the API is opened up we are seeing a new class of interactions

People are now demoing real time identification from their webcams and GPT-4V controlling computers

nitter.net/BenjaminDEKR/sta…
nitter.net/josh_bickett/sta…

This opens up semantic search and understanding of video - huge applications for interpreting:
* Computer screens
* Security cameras
* Meta’s ray ban glasses
* Extracting unstructured data
* Moderation

I put this above the GPT Store because of my confidence (never a good thing to have when making a prediction).

The future is hard to predict but I’m willing to bet this is where we see the most immediate value from

Ok so how do we get started?

The answer is the same as always, go tinker and have fun.

Build an intuition for the tools and find problems you’re passionate about solving.

"What book legitimately changed your life?",1
"The learning process isn't finished when you acquire knowledge. It's complete when you consistently apply that knowledge.

Many people accumulate information. Far fewer use it to evolve and improve.

The ultimate test of growth is closing the gap between awareness and action.",1
"Toxic cultures define success as winning a cutthroat competition. They reward people for stabbing others in the back.

Healthy cultures define success as making a contribution. They reward people for having others’ backs.

Good organizations elevate those who elevate others.",1
"Owning up to your mistakes doesn’t cast doubt on your credibility. Admitting you were wrong shows that you care about getting it right.

Recognizing moments of bad judgment is a step toward demonstrating good judgment.

Issuing a correction is a mark of intellectual integrity.",1
"We carry too much guilt about letting others down—and too little fear of letting ourselves down.

We don't fully control whether we live up to others' expectations. We do decide whether we meet our own.

The most important commitments to uphold are the ones you make to yourself.",1
"Loyalty should never come at the expense of integrity.

Anyone who asks you to violate your values doesn’t deserve your allegiance. Respecting your boundaries is a foundation of trust.

The people worthy of commitment expect you to stand by your principles, not conform to theirs.",1
"Rumors of the dangers of video games are vastly exaggerated.

101 studies, 106k kids & teens: video games have negligible impact on grades, depression, attention, aggression.

Only 3.1% show problematic behaviors—which are more likely symptoms of mental health issues than causes.",1
"Instead of telling kids not to play video games, adults should play too.

Compared to kids who don’t play, those who play 3 hrs/day have better working memory & impulse control. Experiments show cognitive benefits for adults too.

Video games are a form of exercise for the brain.",1
"A common source of disappointment is recency bias: weighing the last week more heavily than the last year.

Zooming in on the immediate past magnifies slumps. Zooming out farther reveals upward slopes.

Progress is rarely visible at a snapshot in time. It unfolds over a lifetime.",1
"Saying no is not as costly as you expect.

11 studies: people overestimate the relationship and reputation risks of turning down requests. People generally don't hold it against you.

Declining doesn't mean you don't care. It means you're taking care not to overextend yourself.",1
"Impostor syndrome is not a sign that other people are overestimating you. It's more likely that you're underestimating your potential.

Confidence is often a consequence of growth, not a cause. Believing in your ability is less important than believing in your ability to improve.",1
"The most undervalued skill of our time is the ability to write.

In an analog world, talking was the main currency of communication and connection. In a digital world, there's a growing premium on the capacity to convey thoughts in text.

The pen is mightier than the spoken word.",1
"Feedback is not about sizing people up. It's about helping them grow.

78 studies: criticism is more motivating when you (a) meet face-to-face; (b) compare behavior to a standard, not to others; (c) suggest changes to make.

People want to improve when it's clear that you care.",1
"Confirmation bias is twisting the facts to fit your beliefs. Critical thinking is bending your beliefs to fit the facts.

Seeking the truth is not about validating the story in your head. It's about rigorously vetting and accepting the story that matches the reality in the world.",1
"Beating yourself up doesn't make you stronger. It leaves you bruised.

Being kind to yourself isn’t about ignoring your weaknesses. It's about giving yourself permission to learn from your mistakes.

We grow by embracing shortcomings, not punishing them.

"A cardinal rule of responsibility: Never expect of others what you're unwilling to do yourself.

If you're not in the office, don't demand that employees show up.

Good managers hold themselves to the same standards as others. Great leaders hold themselves to higher standards.",1
"When you're committed to a goal, it’s motivating to look ahead at how far you have left to go. Staring at the summit fuels grit.

When doubt creeps in, you’re better off looking back at how far you've already come. Seeing your progress builds confidence and commitment.",1
"In toxic cultures, people are rewarded solely for individual results. How they treat others is ignored.

In healthy cultures, people are valued for collective contributions. Pay, performance, and promotions depend on elevating others.

If you're an asshole, you're not a success.",1
"Too many people wait until they're exhausted or depressed to make change or seek help.

Mental health isn't something to put on the back burner. We can't keep good habits in storage until we need them.

Mental hygiene should be as ingrained in our daily routine as dental hygiene.",1
"Insecure arrogance: ""I have all the answers. Only I can fix it.""

Confident humility: ""I have many questions. We need to study what broke it.""

The people to trust are not the ones who project the most confidence. They’re the ones who know the limits of their competence.",1
"Your worth is not defined by what you achieve or acquire. It’s a question of who you become and how you contribute to others.

Self-esteem should come from character, not success or status. The highest accomplishment is to be a person of generosity, curiosity, and integrity.",1
"Job slip is when a job changes without being explicitly thought through and agreed to, generally because of changing circumstances or a temporary necessity. Job slip often leads to the wrong people handling the wrong responsibilities and confusion over who is supposed to do what. #principleoftheday",1
"While that might sound obvious, people often fail to stick to their own responsibilities. Even senior people in organizations sometimes act like young kids just learning to play soccer, running after the ball in an effort to help but forgetting what position they are supposed to play. This can undermine rather than improve performance. So make sure that people remember how the team is supposed to work and play their positions well. #principleoftheday",1
"Eliminate any confusion about expectations and ensure that people view their failures to complete their tasks and achieve their goals as personal failures.

"If you’re interested, you can hear my conversation at the @UN with the legendary ocean explorer @SylviaEarle here: piped.video/live/mDAcW8PqzU8…",1
"Today is World Ocean Day which I just celebrated at the UN. The ocean is our biggest, most important asset, accounting for 72% of the Earth’s surface--so more than twice as much as all continents combined. It is incredibly interesting, valuable, and almost totally ignored. Exploring and sustainably managing it is way more exciting, cost-effective, and important to keeping our planet and all of us healthy than exploring outer space yet only about 1/120th as much money goes into ocean exploration as space exploration. It's for all those reasons that I'm really into ocean exploration. If you want to see more of what OceanX is doing, follow them at @oceanx.",1
"All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didn’t create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to fly or to send cell phone signals around the world came from understanding and applying the existing rules of reality—the physical laws or principles that govern the natural world.

I’ve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life. #principleoftheday",1
"If you keep getting bogged down in details, you either have a problem with managing or training, or you have the wrong people doing the job. The real sign of a master manager is that he doesn't have to do practically anything. Managers should view the need to get involved in the nitty-gritty as a bad sign.

At the same time, there's danger in thinking you're delegating details when you're actually being too distant from what's important and essentially are not managing. Great managers know the difference. They strive to hire, train, and oversee in a way in which others can superbly handle as much as possible on their own. #principleoftheday",1
"Believability applies to management too. The better your track record, the more value you can add as a coach. #principleoftheday",1
"Like a ski instructor, you need to have close contact with your people on the slopes so that you can assess their strengths and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs. There should be a good back-and-forth as they learn by trial and error. With time you will be able to decide what they can and can't handle on their own. #principleoftheday",1
"They can do this by 1) managing others well, 2) job slipping down to do work they're not responsible for because others can't do their jobs well, or 3) escalating what they can't manage well. The first choice is optimal; the second signals that a change is needed in the people and the design; the third choice is harder still but mandatory. #principleoftheday",1
"Great managers orchestrate rather than do. Like the conductor of an orchestra, they do not play an instrument, but direct their people so that they play beautifully together. Micromanaging, in contrast, is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do or doing their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. To be successful, you need to understand these differences and manage at the right level. #principleoftheday",1
"Here is some of my advice for those who are graduating and entering “the real world.” 
 
You’re about to enter the beginning of the second phase of your life which is totally different from the first. Realize that you know virtually nothing about what it’s like so you need to learn what it’s like and how to be great at it. 
 
To be young and have all that adventure ahead of you is wonderful. Make the most of it! Here are some principles that might help you. 

#graduation #principles",1
"While everyone has the right to make sense of things--and is in fact obliged to challenge principles and policies if they conflict with what they believe is the best approach--that's not the same thing as having the right to change them. Changes in policies must be approved by those who made them (or someone else who has been made responsible for evolving them).

When someone wishes to make an exception to an important policy at Bridgewater, they must write up a proposed alternative policy and escalate their request to the Management Committee.

Exceptions should be extremely rare because policies that have frequent exceptions are ineffective. The Management Committee will formally consider it and either reject it, amend it, or adopt it. #principleoftheday",1
"Principles are hierarchical--some are overarching and some are less important--but they all should inform the policies that guide your individual decisions. It pays to think those policies through to ensure that they are consistent with each other and the principles they are derived from.

When faced with a case that doesn't have a clear policy to follow (for example, what to do about an employee whose job is to travel but who faces potential health risks because of his travel), one can't just snatch an answer out of the blue without regard for higher-level principles. Policymakers must make policy in the same way that the judicial system creates case law--iteratively and incrementally, by dealing with specific cases and interpreting the law as it applies to them.

That is how I have tried to operate. When a case arises, I lay out the principles behind how I am handling it and get in sync with others to see if we agree on those principles or must modify them to make them better. By and large, that's how all Bridgewater's principles and policies were developed. #principleoftheday",1
"You don't want the people you work with to merely pay lip service to your community's rules; they should have a high sense of ethics that makes them want to abide by them and hold others accountable for abiding by them, while also working to perfect them. The way to achieve this is via principles that are sound and that have been tested through open discussion. #principleoftheday",1
"I was asked what I think of the debt deal, so here it is in a nutshell. It was as I expected, which is the best the one could expect, though not good enough for the following reasons:

1. Bipartisanship: Grade A.
The middle held together against the extremists in their parties. That's a big thing. Is this the beginning of the emergence of a strong bipartisan middle bound together against the extremists? Let's see how it goes.

2. Dealing with the debt problem of adding too much to a pile of debt that is already too large: Grade D.
It won't make much of a difference.

3. Planning a smart bipartisan commission to make debt and economic reforms: Grade B.
There was recognition that it is desirable for this to happen after the 2024 elections to avoid the conflict in the middle of the election campaign. That is why the two-year extension was sensible.",1
"Don't make the mistake of just having the case-at-hand discussion, because then you are micromanaging (i.e., you are doing your managee's thinking and your managee will mistakenly think that's okay). When having the machine-level discussion, think clearly how things should have gone and explore why they didn't go that way. If you are in a rush to determine what to do and you have to tell the person who works for you what to do, make sure to explain what you are doing and why. #principleoftheday",1
"Think about what type of case it is and what principles apply to that type of case. By doing this and helping others to do this you'll get better at handling situations as they repeat over and over again through time. #principleoftheday",1
"The second purpose is more important than the first because it is how you build a solid organization that works well in all cases. Most people focus more on the first purpose, which is a big mistake. #principleoftheday",1
"No matter how complete any project or plan, there will always be things that come out of nowhere and look like the most important or urgent or attractive thing to focus on. These shiny objects may be traps that will distract you from thinking in a machinelike way, so be on your guard for them and don't let yourself be seduced. #principleoftheday",1

"Metrics show how the machine is working by providing numbers and setting off alert lights in a dashboard. Metrics are an objective means of assessment and they tend to have a favorable impact on productivity. If your metrics are good enough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what your people are doing and how well they are doing it that you can almost manage via the metrics alone.

In constructing your metrics, imagine the most important questions you need answered in order to know how things are going and imagine what numbers will give you the answers to them. Don't look at the numbers that you have and try to adapt them to your purposes, because you won't get what you need. Instead start with the most important questions and imagine the metrics that will answer them.

Remember that any single metric can mislead; you need enough evidence to establish patterns. And of course the information that goes into the metrics must be assessed for accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at the average grade each grader gives; those giving higher average grades might be easy graders and vice versa. Similarly helpful are ""forced rankings,"" in which people must rank co-worker performance from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as ""grading on a curve."" Metrics that allow for independent grading across departments and groups are especially valuable. #principleoftheday",1
"I’m at a stage in my life where my goal is to pass what I’ve learned along to others, and I often get asked for my advice for young people in particular.

You’re at a stage in your life that you are just starting out on the phase in life that I’m ending. I learned some stuff that helped me that I believe can help you.

As you know, I have found that most everything happens over and over again for pretty much the same reasons, so in order to understanding anything, it pays to understand how a typical case unfolds and observe the cause-effect relationships that make it unfold that way. In this exercise, I am going to ask you to look at both the typical life arc and your own life arc and reflect on them, This exercise will help you imagine what probably will come at you, plan for it, and deal with it when it comes.

Not all life arcs are the same, and no arc is better in any way than another—they’re each their own unique journey, reflecting the circumstances faced by and decisions of the person traveling the arc—but the archetypical life lasts about 80 years and evolve in three very different phases. Even if your life arc bears little resemblance to the typical one, my hope is that you’ll find value in reflecting on your journey.

I suggest that you get a few pieces of paper and a pen, copy the basic arc, and put a tick where you are with “me” next to it. Looking through these phases, now how the descriptions of what’s happening to the typical person match up with your own experiences, especially at the critical junctures. The choices you make at these junctures have big implications on the life that you will have. As you will see, the paths we take along the way affect the type of journey we have.

This perspective has helped me and many people I have shared it with, and I hope it will help you too. If you’d like to experience an interactive version of the exercise, you can in the free Principles in Action app here: principles.app.link/",1
"Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists. They are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them. They create process- flow diagrams to show how the machine works and to evaluate its design. They build metrics to light up how well each of the individual parts of the machine (most importantly, the people) and the machine as a whole are working. And they tinker constantly with its designs and its people to make both better.

They don't do this randomly. They do it systematically, always keeping the cause-and-effect relationships in mind. And while they care deeply about the people involved, they cannot allow their feelings for them or their desire to spare them discomfort to stand in the way of the machine's constant improvement. To do otherwise wouldn't be good for either the individuals on the team or the team that the individuals are a part of.

Of course, the higher up you are in an organization, the more important vision and creativity become, but you still must have the skills required to manage/orchestrate well. Some young entrepreneurs start with the vision and creativity and then develop their management skills as they scale their companies; others start with management skills and develop vision as they climb the ladder. But like great musicians, all great managers have both creativity and technical skills. And no manager at any level can expect to succeed without the skill set of an organizational engineer. #principleoftheday",1
"About a year ago, I released an animated video inspired by my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order. Since then, over 35 million people have watched it. Now, I’m releasing an abbreviated, 5-minute version of that animation here: piped.video/BB2r_eOjsPw   
 
I hope you find it valuable and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",1
"You must always be simultaneously trying to accomplish the goal and evaluating the machine (the people and the design), as all outcomes are reflections of how the machine is running. Whenever you identify a problem with your machine, you need to diagnose whether it is the result of a flaw in its design or in the way your people are handling their responsibilities.

Sample size is important. Any problem can be a one-off imperfection or a symptom of root causes that will show up as problems repeatedly. If you look at enough problems, which one it is will become clear. #principleoftheday",1
"I was recently asked - Where do you stand politically?  

I am apolitical because I see myself like a doctor who wants to use my expertise to help those who are in the important jobs of governing do their jobs well. At the same time, if I was forced to choose, I would be a strong bipartisan moderate because I believe that if we don't have a strong bipartisan middle, we will have some form of very damaging civil war between the extremists that those in the middle will get drawn into. Right now, the most important battle to watch is not the one between Republicans and the Democrats - it is the one between the moderates and the extremists. I'm rooting for the moderates and would like to see the strongest and smartest ones be elected. 

As a reminder, I love getting your questions on social media so keep asking me anything!",1
"Higher-level thinking isn't something that's done by higher-level beings. It's simply seeing things from the top down. Think of it as looking at a photo of yourself and the world around you from outer space. From that vantage, you can see the relationships between the continents, countries, and seas. Then you can get more granular, by zooming into a closer-up view of your country, your city, your neighborhood, and finally your immediate environment. Having that macro perspective gives you much more insight than you'd get if you simply looked around your house through your own eyes. #principleoftheday",1
"No matter what work you do, at a high level you are simply setting goals and building machines to help you achieve them. I built the machine that is Bridgewater by constantly comparing its actual outcomes to my mental map of the outcomes that it should be producing, and finding ways to improve it.

I won't say anything specific about how you should set your own organization's goals other than that the high-level principles about goal setting I covered in Life Principles apply equally to individuals and organizations. I will, however, point out that in running your organization, you and the people you work with must be clear on how your lower-level goals--whether they're to produce things cost-effectively, achieve high customer satisfaction, help a certain number of people in need, whatever--grow out of your higher-level goals and values.

No matter how good you are at design, your machine will have problems. You or some other capable mechanic needs to identify those problems and look under the hood of the machine to diagnose their root causes. You or whoever is diagnosing those problems has to understand what the parts of the machine--the designs and the people-- are like and how they work together to produce the outcomes. The people are the most important part, since most everything, including the designs themselves, comes from people. Unless you have a clear understanding of your machine from a higher level--and can visualize all its parts and how they work together--you will inevitably fail at this diagnosis and fall short of your potential.

At Bridgewater, the high-level goal of all of our machines is to create excellent outcomes for our clients--in the returns on their investments, of course, but also in the quality of our relationship and our thought partnership in understanding global economies and markets more broadly. Before we had anything else at Bridgewater, we had this commitment to excellence. Maintaining these extremely high standards has always been a challenge, especially as the pace of our growth and change accelerated. #principleoftheday",1
"You reach a point in all relationships when you must decide whether you are meant for each other--that's common in private life and at any organization that holds very high standards. At Bridgewater, we know that we cannot compromise on the fundamentals of our culture, so if a person cannot operate within our requirements of excellence through radical truth and transparency in an acceptable time frame, he or she must leave. #principleoftheday",1
"There should always be follow-through, not interruption, unless a pressing reason exists (when, say, a person would be a great click for another job that needs to be filled immediately). In a company where things are evolving quickly and people are expected to speak openly, it is natural that there will be a steady stream of opportunities for employees to move into new roles. But if too many people jump from one job to another without fulfilling their responsibilities, the resulting discontinuity, disorder, and instability will be bad for managers, bad for the culture, and bad for the people moving, because they won't be adequately tested in their ability to move things to completion. As a guideline, a year in a job is sufficient before having conversations about a new role, although this isn't black and white--the range could easily vary depending on the circumstances. #principleoftheday",1
"Many people have asked me what I think should be done about the debt ceiling debate and the political dynamic behind it.

"Both affected managers should be in sync that the new role is the best, highest use or escalate up the chain to make a determination. The manager wanting to recruit the person is responsible for not causing a disruption. An informal conversation to see if someone is interested is fine, but there should be no active recruiting prior to getting in sync with the existing manager. The timing of the move should be decided by the existing manager in consultation with relevant parties. #principleoftheday",1

"Note I said ""be cautious."" I didn't say never, because it depends on the circumstances. On the one hand, you want people to stretch themselves and experiment with new jobs. You don't want to get rid of a great person just because he or she tried something new and failed. But on the other hand, if you look at most people in this situation, by and large you'll regret allowing them to step back.

There are three reasons for this: 1) You're giving up a seat for someone else who might be able to advance, and people who can advance are better to have than people who can't; 2) The person stepping back could continue to want to do what they aren't capable of doing, so there's a real risk of them job slipping into work they're not a fit for; 3) The person may experience a sense of confinement and resentment being back in a job that they probably can't advance beyond. Keeping them is generally viewed as the preferable short-run decision but in the long run it's probably the wrong thing to do. This is a hard decision. You need to understand deeply what the person in this situation is like and weigh the costs carefully before deciding. #principleoftheday",1
"Recognize that if they failed in that job, it is because of some qualities they have. You will need to understand what those qualities are and make sure they don't apply to any new role. Also, if you learn that they don't have the potential to move up, don't let them occupy the seat of someone who can.

Remember that you're trying to select people with whom you want to share your life. Everyone evolves over time. Because managers develop a better idea of a new hire's strengths and weaknesses and their fit within the culture than what emerges from the interview process, they are well positioned to assess them for another role if the one they were hired for doesn't work out.

Whenever someone fails at a job, it's critical to understand why they failed and why those reasons won't pose the same problems in a new job. #principleoftheday",1
"It is much worse to keep someone in a job unsuitable for them than it is to fire or reassign them. Consider the enormous costs of not firing someone unsuited for a job: the costs of bad performance; the time and effort wasted trying to train them; and the greater pain of firing someone who's been around awhile (say, five years or more) compared with letting someone go after just a year. Keeping people in jobs they are not suited for is terrible for them because it allows them to live in a false reality while holding back their personal evolution, and it is terrible for the community because it compromises the meritocracy and everyone pays the price. Don't let yourself be held hostage to anyone; there is always someone else. Never compromise your standards or let yourself be squeezed. #principleoftheday",1
"Training is part of a plan to develop people's skills and help them evolve. Rehabilitation is an attempt to create significant changes in people's values and/or abilities. Since values and abilities are difficult to change, rehabilitation is typically impractical. Since people with inappropriate values and inadequate abilities can have a devastating impact on the organization, they should be fired. If rehabilitation is attempted, it is generally best directed by professionals over extended periods of time.

Remember that if you are expecting people to be much better in the near future than they have been in the past, you are probably making a serious mistake. People who repeatedly operate in a certain way will probably continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they're like. Since people generally change slowly, you should expect slow improvement (at best). Instead, you need to change the people or change the design. Since changing the design to accommodate people's weaknesses is generally a bad idea, it is better to sort the people. Sometimes good people ""lose their boxes"" (they get fired from their role) because they can't evolve into Responsible Parties soon enough. Some of them might be good in another position, in which case they should be reassigned within the company; some of them will not and should leave. #principleoftheday",1

"Peter Thiel on the biggest lesson he learned in 10+ years of venture capital

In the clip below, Thiel explains how his biggest miss as a VC (not doing Facebook’s full Series B) led to a key insight:

“Once something works, people often underestimate it. And when things aren’t working, they underestimate how much trouble they’re in.”

When he backtested Founders Fund’s portfolio, he found that every time a company had a big up-round led by a smart investor, it was always a good idea to do your pro rata. And it was almost always a bad idea in a down- or flat-round.

In fact, the steeper the up-round, the cheaper it was.

His biggest miss of the last decade was not doing the full Series B at Facebook. It was a 12x up-round in eight months.

“It was the steepest up-round in that amount of time in any company we’ve been involved in. And in retrospect, that was perhaps also the cheapest… And I think one of the reasons it was so underpriced was that… even the people on the inside often underestimate how much things have changed… You have these subtle but very important points where somehow the leverage and dynamics shift very powerfully and they tend to get very underestimated.”",1

"Perception:
The creator economy is dying.

Reality:
The (true) creator economy — the number of creators on the Internet multiplied by the money they're making every month — is crushing it.

At Circle, our ARR is up 2x y/y and monthly GMV is up 4x y/y. 

I bet if you added up the GMV across all the creator platforms + ad payouts from YouTube/TikTok/Twitch + revenue from sponsor deals, you'd see growth rates similar to what we're seeing.

So, what exactly is dying?

Here's what:

A batch of hype-chasing ""creator economy"" startups which raised big rounds in a 2020/21 environment when they barely had working products, let alone P/MF and revenue.

Despite their dire fundamentals, these teams blew their venture dollars on expensive parties, PR ""collabs"", pool houses, and side projects instead of using it to build a real business.

The zero-rate environment let them get away with it, but reality set when the world changed and they couldn't raise more capital to fund their excess.

These handful of startups are giving 10m+ thriving creators a bad name, and even worse: they're blaming their own failures on the creator economy at large instead of being introspective.

If it isn't obvious, it's never been a better time to be a creator, or to build (legit) businesses serving them.",1

Freeman Dyson has expressed some thoughts on craziness. In a Scientific American article called ""Innovation in Physics,"" he began by quoting Niels Bohr. Bohr had been in attendance at a lecture in which Wolfgang Pauli proposed a new theory of elementary particles. Pauli came under heavy criticism, which Bohr summed up for him: ""We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance at being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.”

To that Freeman added: ""When the great innovation appears, it will almost certainly be in a muddled, incomplete and confusing form. To the discoverer himself it will be only half understood; to everybody else it will be a mystery. For any speculation which does not at first glance look crazy, there is no hope.",1

"I'm loving the New Orleans @jazzfest and want to turn you on to it.  Because I love music festivals, I have been to a bunch and this one is my favorite. I started coming 30 years ago and have been to 26 of them.  

I love it so much because there is no better US music culture than that of New Orleans because it is the oldest and richest. It began in the late 17th century when French colonizers first brought enslaved Africans to New Orleans to be sold in Congo Square. The slaves brought their music and culture which created the blues and gospel and later gave birth to jazz, rock-and-roll, and hip-hop that spread all over the world. And the French brought their great food and culture. So this bouillabaisse of black and French and other cultures has been brewing for a few hundred years and is the fountainhead of most of the greatest music over the last hundred years.

At the Fest there is more great music and food of all types than one can sample, and the festival is the smaller part of the whole thing because the music clubs and restaurants are also abundant and go til all hours. It's funky, which gives it flavor for people who like funky, though some parts are too funky for some people. You can make it as spicy or as mild as you like as there are all sorts of ways to have a great time at the Fest and/or in New Orleans - so you can't help but have a great time. While it's too late to go this year, you might think about going next year. Who knows - maybe I'll see you there. #JazzFest",1

Failing to distinguish between these causes is a common mistake among managers, because managers are often reluctant to appear unkind or judgmental. Also, they know that people assessed this way tend to push back. This is another one of those situations in which you must force yourself to be practical and realistic. #principleoftheday",1
"Knowing what people are like is the best indicator of how well they are likely to handle their responsibilities in the future. At Bridgewater, we call this ""paying more attention to the swing than the shot."" Since good and bad outcomes can arise from circumstances that might not have had anything to do with how the individual handled the situation, it is preferable to assess people based on both their reasoning and their outcomes. I probe their thinking in a very frank way so as not to let them off the hook. Doing this has taught me a lot about how to assess others' logic, and how to have better logic myself. When both the outcomes and the thinking behind them are bad, and when this happens a number of times, I know I don't want them to do that type of thinking anymore.

For example, if you're a poker player and you play a lot of poker, you will win some hands and lose others and on any given night you might walk away with less money than a lesser player who's gotten lucky. It would be a mistake to judge the quality of a player based on just one outcome. Instead, look at how well someone does what they do and the outcomes they produce over time. #principleoftheday",1
"Emotions tend to heat up during most disagreements, especially when the subject is someone's weaknesses. Speak in a calm, slow, and analytical manner to facilitate communication. Put things in perspective by reminding them that their pain is the pain that comes with learning and personal evolution--and that knowing the truth will put them on the path to a much better place. Consider asking them to go away and reflect when they are calm, and have a follow-up conversation a few days later.

Ultimately, to help people succeed you have to do two things: First let them see their failures so clearly that they are motivated to change them, and then show them how to either change what they are doing or rely on others who are strong where they are weak. While doing the first without the second can be demoralizing to the people you are trying to help, doing them both should be invigorating, especially when they start experiencing the benefits. #principleoftheday",1
"Anything that requires change can be difficult. Yet in order to learn and grow and make progress, you must change. When facing a change, ask yourself: Am I being openminded? Or am I being resistant? Confront your difficulties head-on, force yourself to explore where they come from, and you'll find that you'll learn a lot. #principleoftheday",1
"You just have to know what they are like and get a sampling. Regular sampling of a statistically reliable number of cases will show you what a person is like and what you can expect from them. Select which of their actions are critical enough to need preapproval and which can be examined later. But be sure to do the audit, because people will tend to give themselves too much slack or could cheat when they see that they're not being checked. #principleoftheday",1
"You need to be clear in conveying your assessments to your reports and openminded in listening to their replies so you can work on setting their training and career paths together. Recognizing and communicating people's weaknesses is one of the most difficult things managers have to do. It's important for the party receiving feedback to be sympathetic to the person trying to give it, because it's not easy--it takes character on the part of both participants to get to the truth. #principleoftheday",1
"In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than his or her self-assessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions about managers that they wouldn't dare bring up in most companies, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in sync in a high-quality way.

Your reports have to believe that you're not their enemy--that your sole goal is to move toward the truth; that you are trying to help them and so will not enable their self-deception, perpetuate a lie, or let them off the hook. This has to be done in an honest and transparent way, because if someone believes they are being pigeonholed unfairly the process won't work. As equal partners, it is up to both of you to get to the truth. When each party is an equal participant, no one can feel cornered. #principleoftheday",1
"If you believe that something is true about someone, it's your responsibility to make sure that it is true and that the person you're assessing agrees. Of course, in some cases it may be impossible to get in sync (if you believe that someone was dishonest and they insist that they weren't, for example), but in a culture of truth and transparency it is an obligation to share your view and let others express theirs. #principleoftheday",1
"While feedback should be constant, reviews are typically periodic; their purpose is to bring together the accumulated evidence of what a person is like as it pertains to their job performance. If the constant feedback is done well, it will become like a constant review as the bits and pieces will add up to the whole. A review should contain few surprises, because you should continuously be striving to make sense of how the person is doing their job. If you think their job is being done badly, you should have been probing to identify and address the root causes of their underperformance on a case-by-case basis. It's difficult for people to identify their own weaknesses; they need the appropriate probing (not nit-picking) of specific cases by others to get at the truth of what they are like and how they are fitting into their jobs.

In some cases it won't take long to see what a person is like; in other cases it's a lot harder. But over time and with a large enough sample of cases, their track records (the level and the steepness up or down in the trajectories that they are responsible for, rather than the occasional wiggles) should paint a clear picture of what you can expect from them. If there are performance issues, it is either because of design problems (perhaps the person has too many responsibilities) or fit/ abilities problems. If the problems are due to the person's inabilities, these inabilities are either because of the person's innate weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., someone who's five foot two probably shouldn't be a center on the basketball team) or because of inadequate training. A good review, and getting in sync throughout the year, should get at these things. Make sure to make your assessment relative to the absolute bar, not just the progress over time. What matters most is not just outcomes but how responsibilities were handled. The goal of a review is to be clear about what the person can and can't be trusted to do based on what they are like. From there, you can determine what to do about it. #principleoftheday",1
"Recently, I described the big cycle template, consisting of the five major forces. Today I’m sharing the follow-up article, focusing on the great power conflict and what’s going on with China. It is informed by my recent visits to China and discussions with involved parties from elsewhere. Unfortunately, the events are transpiring in a manner consistent with the big cycle template in that we are on the brink of war for all the classic reasons. I hope this is of some help. linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-th…",1
"In reviewing someone, the goal is to see the patterns and to understand the whole picture. No one can be successful in every way (if they are extremely meticulous, for example, they might not be able to be fast, and vice versa). Assessments made in reviews must be concrete; they're not about what people should be like but what they are like. #principleoftheday",1
"Being able to see yourself from a higher level is essential for personal evolution and achieving your goals. So you and the people who report to you should be looking at the evidence of their performance together; for this to go well, you need lots and lots of evidence and an objective point of view. If required, use agreed-upon others to triangulate the picture the evidence presents. #principleoftheday",1
"To help you build your perpetual motion machine, have a clear set of rules and a clear set of metrics to track how people are performing against those rules--and predetermined consequences that are determined formulaically based on the output of those metrics.

The more clear-cut the rules are, the less arguing there will be about whether someone did something wrong. For example, we have rules about how employees can manage their own investments in a way that doesn't conflict with how we manage money for clients. Because these rules are clear-cut, there's no room for argument when a breach occurs.

Having metrics that allow everyone to see everyone else's track record will make evaluation more objective and fair. People will do the things that will get them higher grades and will argue less about them. Of course, since most people have a number of things to do that are of different importance, different metrics have to be used and weighted appropriately. The more data you collect, the more immediate and precise the feedback will be. That is one of the reasons I created the Dot Collector tool to work as it does (providing lots of immediate feedback); people often use the feedback that they get during a meeting to course-correct in the meeting in real time.

Once you have your metrics, you can tie them to an algorithm that spits out consequences. They can be as simple as saying that for every time you do X you will earn Y amount of money (or bonus points), or it can be more complex (for example, tying the weighted mix of metrics grades to various algorithms that provide the estimated compensation or bonus points).

While this process will never be exact, it will still be good in even its crudest form, and over time it will evolve to be terrific. Even when flawed, the formulaic output can be used with discretion to provide a more precise evaluation and compensation; over time it will evolve into a wonderful machine that will do much of your managing better than you could do it on your own. #principleoftheday",1

"The underlying spirit in many debates about the pace of AI progress—that we need to take safety very seriously and proceed with caution—is key to our mission. We spent more than 6 months testing GPT-4 and making it even safer, and built it on years of alignment research that we pursued in anticipation of models like GPT-4.

We expect to continue to ramp our safety precautions more proactively than many of our users would like. Our general goal is for each model we ship to be our most aligned one yet, and it’s been true so far from GPT-3 (initially deployed without any special alignment), GPT-3.5 (aligned enough to be deployed in ChatGPT), and now GPT-4 (performs much better on all of our safety metrics than GPT-3.5).

We believe (and have been saying in policy discussions with governments) that powerful training runs should be reported to governments, be accompanied by increasingly-sophisticated predictions of their capability and impact, and require best practices such as dangerous capability testing. We think governance of large-scale compute usage, safety standards, and regulation of/lesson-sharing from deployment are good ideas, but the details really matter and should adapt over time as the technology evolves. It’s also important to address the whole spectrum of risks from present-day issues (e.g. preventing misuse or self-harm, mitigating bias) to longer-term existential ones.

Perhaps the most common theme from the long history of AI has been incorrect confident predictions from experts. One way to avoid unspotted prediction errors is for the technology in its current state to have early and frequent contact with reality as it is iteratively developed, tested, deployed, and all the while improved. And there are creative ideas people don’t often discuss which can improve the safety landscape in surprising ways — for example, it’s easy to create a continuum of incrementally-better AIs (such as by deploying subsequent checkpoints of a given training run), which presents a safety opportunity very unlike our historical approach of infrequent major model upgrades.

The upcoming transformative technological change of AI is something that is simultaneously cause for optimism and concern — the whole range of emotions is justified and is shared by people within OpenAI, too. It’s a special opportunity and obligation for us all to be alive at this time, to have a chance to design the future together.",1

"This was not a bailout. During the GFC, the gov’t injected taxpayer money in the form of preferred stock into banks. Bondholders were protected and shareholders were diluted to varying degrees. Taxpayer money was put at great risk. Many people who screwed up suffered minimal to no consequences. Those were bailouts. 

Here, shareholders and bond holders have been wiped out. The @FDICgov insurance fund capitalized by premiums paid by banks will absorb any losses. The fund will recoup any losses by assessing more premiums on the banks.  

Had the @FDICgov @USTreasury and @federalreserve not intervened today, we would have had a 1930s bank run continuing first thing Monday causing enormous economic damage and hardship to millions. 

More banks will likely fail despite the intervention, but we now have a clear roadmap for how the gov’t will manage them.  

Bank boards and managements have received a massive wake up call. Being a director or CEO of a bank that fails is no fun: years of litigation, regulatory investigations, personal liability, potential civil and criminal charges, and enormous reputational damage. 

Our gov’t did the right thing. This was not a bailout in any form. The people who screwed up will bear the consequences. The investors who didn’t adequately oversee their  banks will be zeroed out and the bondholders will suffer a similar fate. 

Importantly, our gov’t has sent a message that depositors can trust the banking system. Without this confidence, we are left with three or possibly four too-big-to-fail banks where the taxpayer is explicitly on the hook, and our national system of community and regional banks is toast.

"Many of you have asked me what books and authors have inspired me. In honor of #WorldBookDay, here they are:

River Out of Eden by @RichardDawkins

From the lessons of history by the greatest historians to the forces of evolution, and the journey of overcoming obstacles, these books have changed my perspective forever. #books #principles #worldbookday",1
"Articulate your assessment of a person's values, abilities, and skills up front and share it; listen to their and others' responses to your description; organize a plan for training and testing; and reassess your conclusions based on the performance you observe. Do this on an ongoing basis. After several months of discussions and real-world tests, you and your report should both have a pretty good idea of what he or she is like. Over time this exercise will crystallize suitable roles and appropriate training or it will reveal that it's time for the person to find a more appropriate job somewhere else. #principleoftheday",1
"It's hard to have an objective, open-minded, emotion-free conversation about performance if there is no data to discuss. It's also hard to track progress. This is part of the reason I created the Dot Collector. I also recommend thinking about other ways that people's responsibilities can be put in metrics. One example: You can have people note whether they did or didn't do things on checklists, which you can then use to calculate what percentage of tasks they complete. Metrics tell us whether things are going according to plan--they are an objective means of assessment and they improve people's productivity. #principleoftheday",1
"A few people have asked me what I thought of the defamation suit against Fox

I believe that the extreme and intentional distortions of the truth by those in the media who abuse their first amendment rights are a threat to both our understanding of what is true and our democracy. For that reason, I thought that Fox having to pay a settlement of $787 million and acknowledge “the Court’s finding certain claims about Dominion to be false” was great. The only thing that would have been better would have been for the case to go to trial and become a landmark case.

If you read my book Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order or my posts on this subject (lnkd.in/eauBipzc), you know that I believe that the erosion of truth and trust in media is a classic threat to social order that is typical at the stage in “internal order cycle” we are now in.

It wasn’t always the case that those in media could use the First Amendment to publish sensational, damaging, and inflammatory information. In 1919, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes sensibly ruled against falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater and doing harm. In the US, libel standards varied but were generally more like the standards that now exist in Canada and the UK where defamed parties can prevail in cases in which the published information is shown to be wrong and damaging. The independent media flourished back then and does now in those two countries. Then in the US, the pendulum swung in the direction of almost total freedom in the media with the famous 1964 Supreme Court case, The New York Times Co. vs. Sullivan. This case shifted the standard so that in order to win a libel suit, the defamed party had to prove more than just that harmful false information was published—i.e., the defamed party had to prove that there was “actual malice.” After that ruling, the actions of some in the media pushed the limits even further, taking the ruling as a license to lie and defame (which was an effective way to sell newspapers and books and to boost TV ratings), and the courts were sympathetic to them, so the extremes became even greater.

I think that the excesses and their damages are now beginning to be recognized so the pendulum is beginning to swing back. For example, Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch recently said of Sullivan, it “evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods by means and on a scale previously unimaginable.” This a bipartisan issue about what is good for our country. I encourage you think hard about whether what you read in the media is false or misleading and speak out with your distain for false information when you see it.",1
"Remember: A dot is just a dot; what matters is how they add up. Think of each individual dot as an at-bat in baseball. Even great hitters are going to strike out many times, and it would be foolish to evaluate them based on one trip to the plate. That's why stats like on-base percentage and batting average exist.

In other words, any one event has many different possible explanations, whereas a pattern of behavior can tell you a lot about root causes. The number of observations needed to detect a pattern largely depends on how well you get in sync after each observation. A quality discussion of how and why a person behaved a certain way should help you understand the larger picture.

There are certain times, however, where what someone is like will be clear after very few dots. Like knowing whether someone can sing, it doesn’t take a lot of time. Sometimes a person only has to sing a few bars for you to hear how well they can sing. Reasoning is the same—it often doesn’t take a lot of time to figure out if someone can do it. #principleoftheday",1
"Every observation of a person potentially tells you something valuable about how they operate. As I explained earlier, I call these observations ""dots."" A dot is a piece of data that's paired with your inference about what it means--a judgment about what someone might have decided, said, or thought. Most of the time we make these inferences and judgments implicitly and keep them to ourselves, but I believe that if they are collected systematically and put into perspective over time, they can be extremely valuable when it's time to step back and synthesize the picture of a person. #principleoftheday",1
"I recently gave a speech about how the world order is changing—most importantly how the three cycles that together make up the Big Cycle work, where we are in this Big Cycle, what is now happening in the context of it, and what it means for the future. A number of people told me it was a good brief overview, so I drafted a post based on it that you can read here: linkedin.com/pulse/where-we-…   

My goal is to convey the template as I see it and update my thinking about how events are transpiring relative to it. I will follow this with more in-depth posts about 1) where we are in the credit/debt/market/economic cycle and what’s likely to happen with it and 2) China-US relations and what’s going on with China beyond its relationship with the US.",1
"By synthesizing, I mean converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. Too many people make assessments of people without connecting them to specific data. When you have all the specifics that we have at Bridgewater--the dots, meeting tapes, etc.--you can and must work from the specifics up and see the patterns in the data. Even without such tools, other data such as metrics, testing, and the input of others can help you form a more complete picture of what the person is like, as well as examine what they did. #principleoftheday",1
"Explore them openly with the goal of figuring out how you and your people are built so that the right people can be put in the right jobs #principleoftheday",1
"You've heard the expression ""no pain no gain."" Psychologists have shown that the most powerful personal transformations come from experiencing the pain from mistakes that a person never wants to have again--known as ""hitting bottom."" So don't be hesitant to give people those experiences or have them yourself.

While it is important to be clear to people about what they are doing well, it is even more important to point out their weaknesses and have them reflect on them.

Problems require more time than things that are going well. They must be identified and understood and addressed, while things that are running smoothly require less attention. Instead of celebrating how great we are, we focus on where we need to improve, which is how we got to be so great. #principleoftheday",1
"The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful. Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.

Compliments are easy to give but they don't help people stretch. Pointing out someone's mistakes and weaknesses (so they learn what they need to deal with) is harder and less appreciated, but much more valuable in the long run. #principleoftheday",1
"If you ask everybody in an organization what percentage of the organization's success they're personally responsible for, you'll wind up with a total of about 300 percent. That's just the reality, and it shows why you must be precise in attributing specific results to specific people's actions. Otherwise, you'll never know who is responsible for what – and even worse, you may make the mistake of believing people who wrongly claim to be behind great accomplishments. #principleoftheday",1
"Radical truth doesn't require you to be negative all the time. Point out examples of jobs done well and the causes of their success. This reinforces the actions that led to the results and creates role models for those who are learning. #principleoftheday",1
"People are your most important resource and truth is the foundation of excellence, so make your personnel evaluations as precise and accurate as possible. This takes time and considerable back-and-forth. Your assessment of how Responsible Parties are performing should be based not on whether they're doing it your way but on whether they're doing it in a good way. Speak frankly, listen with an open mind, consider the views of other believable and honest people, and try to get in sync about what's going on with the person and why. Remember not to be overconfident in your assessments, as it's possible you are wrong. #principleoftheday",1
"It's often the case that someone receiving critical feedback gets preoccupied with the implications of that feedback instead of whether it's true. This is a mistake. As I'll explain later, conflating the ""what is"" with the ""what to do about it"" typically leads to bad decision making. Help others through this by giving feedback in a way that makes it clear that you're just trying to understand what's true. Figuring out what to do about it is a separate discussion. #principleoftheday",1

It certainly doesn't capture mine.

I have a lot to say. I’ve spent the last 72 hours writing, texting, and talking to Israelis, Jews, Muslims, and Palestinians. Much of my reaction is going to piss off people on ""both sides,"" but I am exhausted and hurting and I do not think there is any way to discuss this situation without being radically honest about my views. So I'm going to try to say what I believe to be true the best I can.

Let me start with this: It could have been me.

That's a hard thought to shake when watching the videos out of Israel — the concert goers fleeing across an empty expanse, the hostages being paraded through the streets, the people shot in the head at bus stops or in their cars. I went to those parties in the desert, I rubbed shoulders with Israelis and Arabs and Jews and Muslims, I could have easily accepted an invitation to some concert near Sderot and gone without a care, only to be indiscriminately slaughtered. Or, perhaps worse, taken hostage and tortured.

I don’t believe Hamas is killing Israelis to liberate themselves, nor do I believe they are doing it to make peace. They're doing this because they represent the devil on the shoulder of every oppressed Palestinian who has lost someone in this conflict. They're doing it because they want vengeance. They are evening the score, and acting on the worst of our human impulses, to respond to blood with blood — an inclination that is easy to give in to after what their people have endured. It should not be hard to understand their logic — it is only hard to accept that humans are capable of being driven to this. Not defending Hamas is a very low bar to clear. Please clear it.

It’s not possible to recap the entire 5,000 year history of people fighting over this strip of land in one newsletter. There are plenty of easily accessible places you can learn about it if you want to (and, by the way, many of you should — far too many people speak on this issue with an obscene amount of ignorance, loads of arrogance, and a narrow historical lens focused on the last few decades). But I'll briefly highlight a few things that are important to me.

In my opinion, the Jewish people have a legitimate historical claim to the land of Israel. Jews had already been expelled and returned and expelled again a half dozen times before the rise of the Muslim and Arab rule of the Ottoman Empire. Of course it’s messy because we Jews and Arabs and Muslims are all cousins and descendents of the same Canaanites. But Arabs won the land centuries ago the same way Israel and Jews won it in the 20th century: Through conflict and war. The British defeated the Ottoman Empire and then came the Balfour Declaration, which amounted to the British granting the area to the Jewish people, a promise they’d later try to renege on — all before the wars that have defined the region since 1948.

That historical moment in the late 1940s was unique. After World War II, with many Arab and Muslim states already in existence, and after six million Jews were slaughtered, the global community felt it was important to grant the Jewish people a homeland. In a more logical or just world that homeland would have been in Europe as a kind of reparation for what the Nazis and others before them had done to the Jews, or perhaps in the Americas — like Alaska — or somewhere else. But the Jews wanted Israel, the British had taken to the Zionist movement, the British had conquered the Ottoman Empire which handed them control of the land, and America and Europe didn’t want the Jews. As a result, we got Israel.

The Arab states had already rejected a partitioned Israel repeatedly before World War II and rejected it again after the Holocaust and the end of the war. They did not want to give up even a little bit of their land to a bunch of Jewish interlopers who were granted it all of a sudden by British interlopers who had arrived a hundred years prior. Who could blame them? It had been centuries since Jews lived there in large numbers, and now they wanted to return in waves as secularized Europeans. Many of us would probably react the same way. So, just as humans have done forever, they fought. The many existing Arab states turned against the burgeoning new Jewish state. One side won and one side lost. This is the brutal and broken and violent world we live in, but it is what created the global world order we have now.

Are Israelis and British people ""colonizers"" because of this 20th century history? Sure. But that view flattens thousands of years of history and conflict, and the context of World War I and World War II. I don’t view Israelis and Brits as colonizers any more than the Assyrians or the Babylonians or the Romans or the Mongols or the Egyptians or the Ottomans who all battled over the same strip of land from as early as 800 years before Jesus’s time until now. The Jews who founded Israel just happened to have won the last big battle for it.

You can’t speak about this issue in a vacuum. You can't pretend that it wasn't just 60 years ago when Israel was surrounded on all sides by Arab states who wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. Despite the balance of power shifting this century, that threat is still a reality. And you can't talk about that without remembering the only reason the Jews were in Israel in the first place was that they'd spent the previous centuries fleeing a bunch of Europeans who also wanted to wipe them off the face of the planet. And then Hitler showed up.

American partisans have a narrow view of this history, and an Americentric lens that is infuriating to witness. As Lee Fang perfectly put it, ""Hamas would absolutely execute the ACAB lefties cheering on horrific violence against Israelis if they lived in Gaza & U.S. right-wingers blindly cheering on Israeli subjugation of Palestinians would rebel twice as violently if Americans were subjected to similar occupation.""

And yet, many Americans only view modern Israel as the ""powerful"" one in this dynamic. Which is true — they obviously are. It isn't a fair fight and it hasn't been for decades because Israel's government is rich and resourceful, has the backing of the United States and most of Europe, and has an incredibly powerful military. At the same time, Israeli leadership has made technological and military advancements that have further tipped those scales — all while the Israeli government has helped create a resource-thin open air prison of two million Arabs in Gaza.

Conversely, Palestinians are devoid of any real unified leadership, and the Arab world is now divided on the issue of Palestine. Israel is unwilling to give the people in Gaza and the West Bank more than an inch of freedom to live. These are largely the refugees and descendents of the refugees of the 1948 and 1967 wars that Israel won. And you can't keep two million people in the condition that those in the Gaza strip live in and not expect events like this.

I'm sorry to say that while the blood on the ground is fresh. The Israelis who were killed in this attack largely have nothing to do with those conditions other than being born at a time when Israel and Jews have the upper hand in this conflict. Some of the victims weren’t even Israeli — they were just tourists. This is why we describe them as “innocent” and why Hamas has only reaffirmed that they are a brutal terror organization with this attack — an organization that I hope is quickly toppled, for the sake of both the Palestinian people and the Israelis. But as someone with a deep love for Israel, with friends in danger and people I know still missing, it breaks my heart to say it but I'm saying it again because it remains perhaps the most salient point of context in a tangled mess full of centuries of context:

You cannot keep two million people living in the conditions people in Gaza are living in and expect peace.

You can't. And you shouldn’t. Their environment is antithetical to the human condition. Violent rebellion is guaranteed. Guaranteed. As sure as the sun rising.

And the cycle of violence seems locked in to self-perpetuate, because both sides see a score to settle:

1) Israel has already responded with a vengeance, and they will continue to. Their desire for violence is not unlike Hamas’s — it’s just as much about blood for blood as any legitimate security measure. Israel will “have every right to respond with force."" Toppling Hamas — a group, by the way, Israel erred in supporting — will now be the objective, and civilian death will be seen as necessary collateral damage. But Israel will also do a bunch of things they don't have a right to. They will flatten apartment buildings and kill civilians and children and many in the global community will probably cheer them on while they do it. They have already stopped the flow of water, electricity, and food to two million people, and killed dozens of civilians in their retaliatory bombings. We should never accept this, never lose sight that this horror is being inflicted on human beings. As the group B’Tselem said, “There is no justification for such crimes, whether they are committed as part of a struggle for freedom from oppression or cited as part of a war against terror.” I mourn for the innocents of Palestine just as I do for the innocents in Israel. As of late, many, many more have died on their side than Israel's. And many more Palestinians are likely to die in this spate of violence, too.

Unfortunately, most people in the West only pay attention to this story when Hamas or a Palestinian in Gaza or the West Bank commits an act of violence. Palestinian citizens die regularly at the hands of the Israeli military and their plight goes largely unnoticed until they respond with violence of their own. Israel had already killed an estimated 250 Palestinians, including 47 children, this year alone. And that is just in the West Bank.

2) Every single time Israel kills someone in the name of self-defense they create a handful of new radicalized extremists who will feel justified in wanting to take an Israeli life in retribution sometime in the future. Half of Gaza’s two million people are under the age of 19 — they know little besides Hamas rule (since 2006), Israeli occupation, blockades, and rockets falling from the sky. The suffering of these innocent children born into this reality is incomprehensible to me. They will suffer more now because of Hamas’s actions and Israel’s response, all through no fault of their own.

There is no way out of this pattern until one side exercises restraint or leaders on both sides find a new solution. Israelis will tell you that if Palestinians put their guns down then the war would end, but if Israel put their guns down they'd be wiped off the planet. I don't have a crystal ball and can’t tell you what is true. But what I am certain of is that every time Israel kills more innocents they engender more rage and hatred and recruit more Palestinians and Arabs to the cause against them. There is no disputing this.

So, why did this happen now?

I'm not sure how to answer that question except to say it was bound to happen eventually. It was a massive policy and intelligence failure and Netanyahu should pay the price politically — he is a failed leader. Iran probably helped organize the attack and the money freed up by the Biden administration's prisoner swap probably didn't help the situation, either. Israel's increasingly extremist government and settlers provoking Palestinians certainly didn't help. Nor has going to the Al-Aqsa mosque and desecrating it. Nor do blockades and bombings and indiscriminate subjugation of a whole people. Nor does refusing to talk to non-terrorist leaders in Palestine. Nor does illegally continuing to expand and steal what is left of Palestinian land, as many Jews and Israelis have been doing in the 21st century despite cries from the global community to stop. A violent response was predictable — in fact, plenty of people did predict it.

Israel is forever stuffing these people into tinier and tinier boxes with fewer and fewer resources. But if you want to blame Israeli leaders for continuing to expand and settle land that does not belong to them (as I do), then you should also spare some blame for Palestinian leaders for repeatedly not accepting a partitioned Israel during the 20th century that could have led to peace (as I do).

Please also remember this: Hamas is still an extremist group. The Palestinian people do not have a government or leaders who legitimately represent their interests, and it sure as hell isn't Hamas. Will some Palestinians cheer and clap at the dead, or spit on them as they are paraded through Gaza? Yes they will. And they have. Many will also mourn because they loathe Hamas and know this will only make things worse. This is no different than how some Americans cheer at the dead in every single war we've ever fought. It's no different than the Israelis who set up lawn chairs to watch their government bomb Palestine and cheer them on, too. This doesn't mean Palestinians or Israelis or Americans are evil — it means some of them are giving in to their violent impulses, and their zealous feelings of righteous vengeance.

Solutions, you ask? I can’t say I have any. If you came here for that, I’m sorry. The two-state solution looks dead to me. A three-state solution makes some sense but feels out of the view of all the people who matter and could make it happen. I wish a one-state solution felt realistic — a world of Israelis and Arabs and Muslims and Jews living side by side with equal rights, fully integrated and defused of their hate, is a version of Israel that I would adore. But it seems less and less realistic with every new act of violence.

"When I joined HubSpot many moons ago, there was 1 product hub box on this image (Marketing Hub). When I left there were 3 (+ CRM, + Sales Hub). There are now 7.

There are three ways to go multi-product, and HubSpot's been a master at repeating one of them. 

It's a big reason why they’ve grown revenue from $82M in Q1 2017 to $529M in Q2 2023 🤑

@far33d, @onecaseman  and I broke this down in episode 3 of 🎙️ Unsolicited Feedback (full video and episode in te thread).

3️⃣ The Three Ways To Go Multi Product 3️⃣
There are three strategies to go multi-product:

1. Same Market, New Product (Product Expansion)
2. Same Product, New Market (Market Expansion)
3. New Product, New Marketing (Diversification)

HubSpot has been running #1 (Product Expansion) extremely well. They’ve been insistent on staying in SMB (more M than S as @bhalligan  and @dharmesh  use to say) even though the common play/advice is to move up market to enterprise.

↔️ HubSpot's Product Expansion ↔️
HubSpot has kept the segment of the market the same, but keep parlaying one product and functional buyer into an adjacent product and functional buyer.

Starting with going from the Marketing to the Sales function. Early in that transition, the early adopters were HubSpot customers where the marketing leader had a lot of influence over sales. Then we eventually learned how to market and sell directly into sales.

That repeated itself from Sales → Success since two functions tend to be tied at the hip. Then Success → Ops.

💳>🤖 Commerce Hub Is Sexier Than AI IMO 💳>🤖
Hot take. I think the addition of Commerce Hub is more interesting than AI. Commerce Hub is their payments and billing product.

First, if you’ve ever dealt with payments at a company you know it sucks. Having that tightly integrated to support and sales definitely speeds transactions up.

Second, it represents the first product expansion to take on a whole new pricing model (that I know of) and as a result create a new long-term growth driver for the company.

Commerce Hub will start charging on a percentage of a transaction amount not a per seat or contact model like the rest of the product portfolio.

💰 Shopify of B2B Companies? 💰
The reason I find this so interesting is that the value HubSpot can capture is no longer tied to the size of the team or contact database, it’s tied to the revenue of their customer base.

That’s part of the beauty. The value capture on this product is tied to the value that HubSpot is helping create with all its products (more sales, more customers, more revenue).

It reminds me a lot of Shopify. Shopify makes 4X the revenue based on their merchant solutions product than they do on their SaaS fees.

I’m glad I was a very brief part of this company’s history. 

The growth and execution continue to be amazing. Kudos to that entire team 🙌",1

- Banned Assault Weapons
- Ensured Women's reproductive freedoms as rights.

I'm running because San Francisco has become a Party of No. Politicians tell us no to housing, no to safe streets, no to small business.

I'm running to be elected to the SF Democratic Party and return it to a Party of Yes.

Here's how.

The politicians in this city are fixated on ideology and tribal politics, leaving them completely out-of-touch with the people they are elected to serve. We used to be focused on big ideas. We used to collaborate. But we lost our way in San Francisco.

As the child of immigrants who currently rents and resides in the Tenderloin, I have seen the promise of what our city and community can offer. I have worked in the public and private sectors, and have seen how innovation can bring progress. It's time we apply that same progress to San Francisco's government.

Running for, and being elected as, a member of the Democratic Party gives us an opportunity to ensure that progress. We will advocate for legislation and partner with elected officials to usher in new and bolder ideas.

That’s why I am releasing a first of its kind visual political platform - representing a bold new vision for how we can create a safe and vibrant San Francisco.

Our plan, represented in four beautiful illustrations designed by @VladSF, focuses on bold ideas to reform San Francisco. Academic villages to recover our downtown, centralized government services as mobile hubs to address homelessness, night markets to bolster our small business, and a green mile to reshape our transit infrastructure.

bilalmahmood.com/

But we have to not only think bigger to realize this vision. We have to work together.

No longer can we reflexively say no to any idea. It's time to end the excuse-making and ideological battles of the past. I am running to present a better path. One where we not only think bigger, but also collaborate and build consensus.

Because only together can we build bridges across San Francisco's political lines, and get the results we so desperately need to turn our city around.

I hope you'll join me in this journey.

"The Heart Attack Gun was developed by the Central Intelligence Agency, with its origins rooted in the Cold War era of the 1950s and 1960s.  

 During this period, the CIA was intently focused on countering threats and potential assassinations from foreign entities. The device was designed with utmost secrecy to kill individuals by inducing a heart attack, while leaving little to no traceable evidence behind.  

In terms of its mechanics, the Heart Attack Gun fired a specialized dart made of frozen shellfish toxin. This dart could effectively penetrate both clothing and skin. Once it hit the target, the toxin would be released into the bloodstream, causing a heart attack within minutes.   

The toxin would denature rapidly, erasing any tangible evidence of foul play. Adding another layer of stealth, the weapon had an effective range of up to 100 meters and was virtually noiseless upon firing, making it extremely difficult to detect.  

The existence of this eerie device came to public light in 1975 during a Senate committee hearing led by Senator Frank Church. Senator Church dramatically revealed the weapon, thus confirming speculations and concerns about the lengths to which intelligence agencies would go for covert operations.",1

"The rapid pace of technological innovation has brought about an unyielding rule in the tech industry - either ride the wave of each new innovation or risk being left behind. As someone who has spent the past few months immersed in the world of artificial intelligence (AI), I have become captivated by its potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives. Just take a look at my YouTube subscriptions, podcast list, and the plethora of unread PDFs and research papers on my tabs, all centered around gaining a deeper understanding of this impending technological breakthrough.

The reason behind my obsession with AI is crystal clear. Over the past decade, those who ignored the rise of mobile or on-demand startups like Airbnb and Uber found themselves struggling to keep up with the rapidly changing landscape. Similarly, those who clung to desktop software instead of embracing the internet, or preferred Web 1.0 over the user-generated content of Web 2.0, were left lagging behind. The lesson is clear - in each new wave of innovation, even prominent technology executives and CEOs must adapt or risk being left in the dust.

This is what I find truly fascinating about the tech industry - every five to ten years, everything changes. The order of things is reset, and past success does not guarantee future triumph. Herein lies the advantage for new and relatively inexperienced founders. They possess a native understanding of the latest technologies, without the need to start from scratch and navigate the challenges that come with it. What might have seemed illogical a decade ago can now be achieved through AI.

I find myself at the forefront of this ever-evolving landscape, where investors have historically been hesitant to invest in the games industry due to the high costs of content creation. However, with the advent of AI, there is potential for a game-changing shift. This is just one example of how AI has the power to disrupt various industries. Personally, I admit to feeling a sense of unease when riding these new waves. As one progresses in their career, it becomes increasingly challenging to invest the time and energy required to learn new things, build new relationships, and keep up with emerging companies and products.

A few years ago, I experienced similar apprehension during the rise of Web 3, and before that, during the mobile and Web 2.0 revolution. Yet, I believe this is the beauty of the tech industry - the existence of a reset button that gives everyone a fair chance to build the next groundbreaking innovation. I am genuinely curious to hear from all of you about your strategies for riding each new wave. For those who have witnessed numerous waves of change, some may jest that you possess a heat-seeking instinct. However, the truth is that when these waves are monumental, one must indeed seize the opportunity.

So, I pose this question to all of you - how do you stay fresh, informed, and connected in this ever-evolving landscape? I am certain that each of you has valuable insights and experiences to share. Lastly, what makes AI particularly intriguing is its horizontal nature. It has the potential to impact every layer of the technology stack, from infrastructure to consumer-facing products with a design-oriented focus. Furthermore, AI holds the promise of being applicable across various industries. It is incumbent upon all of us to delve deeper into this realm and start building the future.

In conclusion, the tech industry's constant innovation demands our attention and adaptability. We must embrace each new wave and constantly seek ways to remain current and connected. AI, with its potential to reshape multiple sectors, serves as a powerful reminder of the need to continually learn and innovate. So let us all embark on this journey together, armed with curiosity and a determination to create the next great thing.",1

Of course new cos will be built that won’t use AI, just as some web oriented biz software is still being built. But that’s not where the heat and excitement",1
"2/ you have to surf each new wave bc ignoring past tech trends like mobile, on-demand startups, Web 2.0 or the Internet left many in the dust.

"Some random thoughts on Threads now that it’s been a few days:

- wow wow so many signups. It’s all the more impressive given it feels like a big change in strategy from their previous cross-sell situation, when the Messenger app was linked to the bottom of the big blue app. I haven’t seen any overt cross-sell prompts/etc from IG/FB (but maybe someone can correct me here). The fact so many folks have signed up - far above and beyond the small group that might be following Elon vs Zuck or whatever tech twitter meme of the day - tells you there’s a lot of latent demand here. Interesting to note the geo breakdown which includes a lot of developing markets, not just the US. Of course the issue is that Google+ (which failed) also had huge initial signups, and the Threads team will be familiar with all their mistakes and hopefully not repeat them. But I think not force-feeding all Meta users with Threads is a good idea

- we obv don’t know anything about the retention (yet), though the Threads team is definitely tracking closely. Given that the app is adding so many users so quickly, and you’re into large enough numbers that there’s likely very low-intent, low-connectivity type users. The latest retention is likely to be much worse than the initial. So when the new user signups begin the peak, we’ll get a flurry of (wrong/misguided) “threads is over” media articles, when the real question is if the density of the network supports activity

- imho twitter is likely to be “killed” by threads in its current form. I think you have to look at the content creator side to understand why. While people love a big conflict story, but the reality is, if you are an active creator on the Twitter network and you have a lot of followers, you are much more likely to just cross-post content than to switch to the other network exclusively. 

- a lot of creation is likely novelty and small network size. Obv we are seeing a lot of novelty value and thus people are posting a ton right now, but curious to see how long it lasts. Similarly, the network feels smaller and more intimate. Historically it’s been hard to figure out how to keep posts/DAU high while scaling the network, because of “context collapse”

- new media formats (usually) drive creator switching. Obv Threads is very very new and the team over there likely has 2+ years of product roadmap already in mind. Part of the product roadmap, I have to guess, has to be some major ideas on making content creation easier, better, or maybe just… different. That’s the only way to get creators to permanently stick to something, either because you are recruiting people who are great at a new format of short vids, or audio, or pithy texts, or otherwise. If Twitter is about short text messages and Threads is as well, I think the outcome is more likely stalemate where both services are at least somewhat successful, rather than one being much bigger than the other

- the use of the IG graph to bootstrap the network is impressive. Lots of cool ideas: Porting over the username, bio, verified status etc. Being able to “pre follow” people who haven’t yet signed up. Lots of cool stuff here.

- lots of cool innovations at the edges. In using the Threads product, I’m enjoying all the small design decisions. The feed surfaces more, and you mute — kind of an opt-out, rather than twitter’s opt-in follow scheme. The product is currently simpler but got a lot of the core actions right away

Anyway, it’ll be cool to see how this all plays out - as others have noted, it’s been a while that a new v 1.0 of an app from a large company has seen a ton of traction",1
"Hello from Wyoming! On a national park road trip and thought I’d jot down a few random thoughts since I haven’t in a while.

Today’s topic:
The next big tech hub looks like it’ll be in… San Francisco?

Maybe an obvious reversion to the mean that was bound to happen. But many friends moved to secondary tech hubs (including myself!) now find ourselves perpetually headed back to SF on a monthly basis. We’re all drawn to the inescapable pull of fresh new startups, interesting new people, etc…

Couple reasons:
1) the generative AI boom
2) slowdowns in many emerging sectors
3) tourists are out
4) the nomadic tribes are settling down
5) maybe remote work just isn’t as good?

Let’s discuss each.

The AI boom is obvious so I won’t spend too much time on it, but the more interesting point is the source of the talent. Because a lot of the work right now is at the level of infra and foundational models, the top companies draw from top-flight engineering skillset that’s often closely aligned to infra/platforms, big data, machine learning, academia, etc. These aren’t the design-centric frontend engineers that powered the final stage of the S-curve for Web 2.0 and mobile. Where are these folks located? Mostly in SF, and often from FAANG/universities/etc who have been working on AI research for the past decades

At the same time as the AI boom that draws on SF-specific talent, a lot of the new tech hubs had various specializations - like fintech in London or creator economy in LA, etc. These sectors, while still attracting top founders, just aren’t quite as hot as they were a few years ago. This in turn leads to these magnetic tech hubs becoming less of a draw. If a lot of founders who would have done fintech/creators/web3/etc end up getting excited about AI, they might choose a different city in which to base their operations

Many of the the newer tech hubs have more angels/founders/others who dabble in tech, but risk being labeled tourists when the macro economy gets tough. In LA, for instance, you might have a large swath of the entertainment/media industry experimenting with VR/web3/otherwise when the market was hot — now that there’s been a slowdown, many are turtling up, focused on their core businesses, and there’s less interest in tech. I think the same is happening across many of the new tech hubs.

In the year after COVID, there was a big nomadic tribe of ex-SF techies who would jump from city to city. They put their personal items in storage in SF, and then would rotate from spending a few months in NYC followed by Austin, then LA in the winter, etc — doing some Airbnb hopping. My personal observation is that this group has settled down quite a lot, some heading back to SF and others staying in a city. This has made the second tier of tech hubs less dynamic as a result.

Finally- I think now that we’ve been doing endless Zoom meetings for two years now, we can agree that sometimes the experience of working remote simply isn’t as good, nor as productive, particularly for early pre-product/market fit startups. When iteration cycles have to be tight, and you need a small group to mind-meld with each other, there’s just a big plus to being in person. And if you’re going to be in person, there’s a good chance a big chunk of your team is already based in SF.

And thus, a lot of us are spending a good chunk of time in SF, on a regular basis.

This doesn’t mean that the new tech hubs will fail. They got a big growth spurt, a ton of people, press coverage (and capital). Many companies ended up being started in these towns that won’t leave, and just will just grow up instead. That’s all great.

But I do think the SF tech community has proved to be very resilient, and we’re seeing a big countertrend to the past few years.",1

"Excellent essay from @noam on “The real story of how Facebook almost acquired Waze, but we ended up with Google”

post.news/@/noam/2RTRvTNNxSC…

Lots of great learnings, summarized by chatGPT 😎

1. The co-founders of Waze established a valuation framework before entertaining acquisition offers. They decided to reject offers less than $750M and accept offers above $1B, but would consider proposals in the $750M-$1B range depending on the acquirer.
2. Waze approached potential strategic partners to help accelerate user acquisition, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, leading to potential acquisition discussions.
3. The founders established relationships with potential acquirers' product teams well in advance, providing a critical foundation for the acquisition process.
4. Initial negotiations with Google ended in a $450M offer which was rejected based on the pre-established valuation framework. This prompted backlash from the board but the founders remained firm.
5. Facebook offered to acquire Waze for $1B swiftly after being informed of a competing offer. Despite initial enthusiasm, the due diligence process revealed gaps and tension between the Waze and Facebook teams, leading to the deal falling through.
6. Following the leak of the Facebook deal, Google presented an unsolicited term sheet of $1.15B. Despite accusations of information leakage, Waze's fiduciary duty led them to consider the offer, leading to a fallout with Facebook.
7. With no counteroffer from Facebook, Waze accepted Google's offer and closed the transaction in eight days.
8. In hindsight, despite the potential financial benefits of a Facebook deal, the Waze co-founder believed Google was the right choice due to cultural fit, their commitment to Waze's independence, and Facebook's subsequent controversies.
9. The lessons learned included: building relationships with potential acquirers early, having a clear valuation framework, recognizing partnership discussions as catalysts for acquisition, understanding the personal nature of acquisitions, and being aware of the divergence in interests between founders and investors during an acquisition.
10. The final key lesson was understanding the power of negotiation, having a red line, and being willing to walk away to secure a better deal.",1

""The pictures were taken by my father who was serving aboard HMS Sphinx while on armed patrol off the Zanzibar and Mozambique coast in about 1907. They caught quite a few slavers and those particular slaves that are in the pictures happened while he was on watch. That night a dhow (sailing vessel) sailed by and the slaves were all chained together. He raised the alarm and they got them on to the ship and got the chains knocked off them. They then questioned them and sent a party of marines ashore to try to track the slave traders down. They caught two of them and I believe they were of Arabic origin. My father thought the slave trade was a despicable thing that was going on, the slaves were treated very badly so when they got the slavers they didn’t give them a very nice time”. ⁣",1

"sometimes I can't believe I spent 3 years writing a book BEFORE chatGPT came out :)

Many of you know that for my book, THE COLD START PROBLEM, focused on tech marketing, that I spent nights and weekends for 3 years to put it together. The first step was to write a large outline, which was 3-5 pages, which was then turned into 30-50 pages. Then eventually each of those pages was turned into paragraphs that covered 10x pages each, so that the final product was about 400. This process of successive outlining was incredibly time consuming, and there were many points where it felt like... THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY.

It's fun to play with ChatGPT and see the alternate universe where I had the tool to work on it. It'd be so so much easier...

To demonstrate a bit how much easier it is to develop the topics around a book, here's a prompt I used around the idea of writing a book about pivoting your product.

Here goes:

""I want to read a new book about Startups and the problem of pivoting from one product to another when the product is not able to find product market fit. I want to use some case studies of successful pivots for example, Justin TV to twitch or Microsoft programming, languages to operating systems or slack from their video game to the communication software.

I want to create an outline that includes the concept of pivoting how to decide when to pivot the potential ways to execute, the pivot short, falls in executing a pivot incorrectly, and how to Judge success. For example, sometimes when a pivot is done incorrectly, it’s because it’s involving too large of a team and the company actually needs to fire quite a lot of people.  Please take this invite, and create a book outline. 

Please include 10 major sections, and then five points underneath each of the sections that and then be developed in more detail.""

The result is not perfect but OMG it's pretty damn good. I attached the image.

You could imagine now taking each of these sections and having it further filled out by ChatGPT, while you focus on making everything hang together. And which examples make sense.

I think this would have radically shortened the time it took me to write a 100,000 word book. Maybe still a year, if you wanted to really handcraft things and edit at the end, but nevertheless a dramatic speedup

Great to really try it out.",1

"I recently attended my 10-year Stanford University reunion.

10 lessons I learned:

1. Identity is the real thing we're searching for.

Everyone thinks they're looking for money or success, but what they're really looking for is identity. The search for identity is the common thread that connects everyone. Identity is fluid—embrace it in the present, diversify to lower your risk, and seek out new perspectives to challenge yourself.

2. Your daily habits show up on your face after 10 years.

When you're young, you can get away with treating your body and mind like crap. But you can't hide forever. 10 years later, your good (or bad) daily habits show up on your face.

3. The Medici Effect is real.

The Medici family's funding of the arts created a talent and idea density in Florence that gave rise to the Renaissance. College campuses are mini versions of 15th century Florence. Many had left campus and never experienced anything like it again. Conversely, those who made an effort to frequent high density locations had experienced the benefits.

4. Insecurity tells, confidence shows.

People who are crushing it rarely feel a need to tell you that they’re crushing it. Insecurity is loud, confidence is quiet.

5. Plans are great, but life will generally laugh at them.

Those who are thriving had kept their compass pointed to the north, but learned to take the blows and pivot on the fly. Laugh at your plans and keep moving forward.

6. Fighting the Zebra Effect is hard (but worth it).

Researchers struggled to study zebras because the stripes blended together in packs, so they placed a red dot on the side of zebras they wanted to track. They were quickly eaten by lions. Blending in is a survival mechanism. But it's only by taking risk to stand out that you accomplish remarkable things.

7. Freedom is rare, but incredibly apparent.

There were very few people who seemed truly free. The rare few had been intentional about building freedom into their lives. They weren't the richest, but their energy was infectious.

8. We get more embarrassing with age.

I used to wonder why parents were so embarrassing. Now I know, we get more embarrassing with age—or we just mature enough to be comfortable with ourselves. At the class party, we danced poorly and sang off tune. Proudly embarrassing.

9. Shared struggle builds unbreakable bonds.

My baseball teammates and I crawled through the metaphorical (and literal) mud together. Those bonds were forged through suffering, and they are not easily broken. Find the people you'd crawl through the mud with.

10. Life is much more fragile than you think.

Since 2013, we've lost several classmates and loved ones. But amidst the sadness, real beauty has come from it: Everyone is much quicker to smile, hug, and say ""I love you"" to an old friend.

"The ongoing destruction of Gaza is horrific. Countless innocent civilians are being killed or severely injured. My Orthodox Christian relatives have nothing to do with terrorism, but they haven’t been spared from death, pain, and grief.

When I spoke with a family member several days ago, I heard the blast of an airstrike near the church and the fear in his voice. He hadn’t slept in days. Young relatives woke up startled, terrified they might not survive. Now we can’t even communicate with any of them.

"This has been a year full of engineering excellence that sometimes can go unnoticed. Besides all the visible changes you see on our app, here are some of the most important improvements we have made under the hood.

- Consolidated the tech stacks for For you, Following, Search, Profiles, Lists, Communities and Explore around a singular product framework.

- Completely rebuilt the For you serving and ranking systems from the ground up, resulting in a decrease 90% reduction in lines of code from 700K to 70K, a 50% decrease in our compute footprint, and an 80% increase in the throughput of posts scored per request.

- Unified the For you and video personalization and ranking models, which significantly improved video recommendation quality.

- Refactored the API middleware layer of our tech stack and in doing so simplified the architecture by  removing more than 100K lines of code and thousands of unused internal endpoints and eliminating unadopted client services.

- Reduced post metadata sourcing latency by 50%, and global API timeout errors by 90%.

- Blocked bots and content scrapers at a rate +37% greater than 2022. On average, we prevent more than 1M bots signup attacks each day and we’ve reduced DM spam by 95%.

- Shutdown the Sacramento data center and re-provisioned the 5,200 racks and 148,000 servers, which generated more than $100M in annual savings. In total, we freed up 48 MW of capacity and tore down 60k lbs. of network ladder rack before re-provisioning it to other data centers.

- Optimized our usage of cloud service providers and began doing much more on-prem. This shift has reduced our monthly cloud costs by 60%. Among the changes we made was a shift of all media/blob artifacts out of the cloud, which reduced our overall cloud data storage size by 60%, and separately, we succeeded in reducing cloud data processing costs by 75%.

- Built on-prem GPU Supercompute clusters and designed, developed, and delivered 43.2Tbps of new network fabric architecture to support the clusters.

- Scaled network backbone capacity and redundancy, which resulted in $13.9M/year in savings.

- Started automated peak traffic failover tests to validate the scalability and availability of the entire platform continuously.",1

"On mental health, many leaders are still out of touch.

The vast majority of execs think they're caring and employees are thriving. Nearly half their people disagree.

Caring is more than showing concern. It's reaching out to see who's hurting and taking action to help them heal.",1
"Employees are not resources to manage. They’re humans to value.

Bad managers only care about your results. Good managers care about your well-being. Great managers care more about your well-being than your results.

We do our best work when leaders put people above performance.",1
"The goal of a great discussion isn't to land on the same page. It’s to explore different views.

Nods and smiles stroke your ego and close your mind. Thoughtful questions stoke your curiosity and stretch your thinking.

Consensus makes you comfortable. Dissent makes you smarter.",1
"Questioning your abilities doesn’t mean you have impostor syndrome. It’s a normal response to a new challenge or a difficult task.

The absence of doubt breeds arrogance. Feeling unsure maintains humility.

A lack of confidence is a reminder that you have something to learn.",1
"Not having an opinion is not a sign of ignorance or indifference. It's often a mark of an open mind.

The more complex and consequential the issue, the more critical thinking depends on suspending judgment.

A key to learning is gathering information without forming a conclusion.",1

No one grows up dreaming of a job that doesn't interfere with their life. We hope to spend our waking hours doing work that enriches our lives.

A toxic job drains you. A decent job sustains you. A healthy job invigorates you.",1
"Loyalty doesn't require conformity. If consensus is wrong, you have an obligation to disagree.

Weak leaders demand deference. Strong leaders welcome dissent.

Lies erode trust. We count on people who tell the truth. Candor fuels closeness.",1
"People with a surplus of confidence and a shortage of character never fail to disappoint.

Leadership skill is inversely related to the size and fragility of the ego.

Humility, generosity, and honor are underrated virtues. The most principled person is the best poised to serve.",1
"The most important measure of success is not status, power, or wealth. It's how much freedom you have—and how much freedom you give.

Choosing how to spend your time and share your ideas is a right. Using your resources to help others gain that right is a responsibility.",1
"It shouldn't take a pandemic to convince people to put their mental health above their careers.

In the long run, the choice between success and well-being is a false dichotomy.

The best way to achieve your goals is to lead a life that invigorates you—not one that drains you.",1
"It’s hard to change people’s values. It’s easier to appeal to the values they already hold.

When you push your principles, people shut down. If you speak to their principles, they open up.

"CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER HIRING

Over the past few years, I've seen several top private tech companies part with their Head of Product / CPO in less than a year.  The symptoms are many, but the root cause is the inability for the product-centric CEO to treat the CPO as someone more than a roadmap executor, while the CPO desired to be more strategic.  

Post CPO exit, in some cases, the CEO has taken on the CPO responsibilities and eliminated the role; in other cases, the Head of Eng  consolidated design and product under them to form a unified EPD team.

Note that the importance of the PM role is not in question at any of these companies; it's the (need for the) role of the CPO / Head of Product.

Underscores that the CPO role is one of the hardest ones to successfully hire for. 

CEOs: Your unique role as CEO is not to assess if these candidates can successfully build products, but rather to determine if they can successfully build products with YOU.

CPO candidates: Probe deeply for why the CEO wants a CPO. Is it to delegate tactical work? Or is to truly be a thought partner?",1

Congratulations to 21yo computer science student @LukeFarritor who is the first person to see this handwriting in nearly 2000 years. He has won the $40,000 First Letters prize for this world-historical achievement.

We are also awarding a $10,000 First Ink prize to @CJHandmer who was the first person to see ink and multiple letters within an unopened scroll. His work was the basis of Luke's ML model.

And @Youssef_M_Nader has won a $10,000 second-place First Letters prize for producing the clearest and most comprehensive images from inside a scroll yet.

This has been the dream of many people since the scrolls were first discovered in the 1750s. It is also the result of 20 years of work from Dr. Brent Seales and his team at EduceLab, whose years of dedicated work have made this last mile possible.

- the opportunity for government to advance AI research/startups
- why some are fear driven about edge cases, and the risks of stifling innovation
- how genAI might supercharge creative jobs Vs how it might enable new forms of creation
- why both startups AND incumbents are embracing tech, rather than the typical innovators dilemma pattern of incumbents rejecting it
- how the UK’s approach tries to balance regulating too early versus having some kind of early framework",1
"My first event for @Techweek_ :) Get the full calendar here: tech-week.com

Super fun discussion about the new funding environment and what startups that are raising their seed/A/B need to think about these days

some themes:
- how the decline in late stage financing affects early stage
- founders think about the funding round ahead of them, but investors think about the next round
- why startups should prioritize efficient growth over high burn + high growth
- how narrative + metrics need to work together, particularly the ""why now""
- why later stage cos are having a tougher time than preseed/seed

Loved meeting everyone! Thanks to @chrisrohaut and the @codiwork for hosting me!",1

"The most important thing you can do is understand that hiring is a high risk gamble that needs to be approached deliberately. A lot of time, effort, & resources go into hiring and developing new employees before it’s clear whether or not they are good fits. #principleoftheday 1/2",1
"So who are the people in your organization behind the results and culture that make it special? Think about who they are and how they work together to make it what it is. (4/4)",1
"People tend to personify organizations (""Apple is a creative company"") while mistakenly depersonalizing their results, thus losing sight of who did what to produce them. That's misguided because companies don't make decisions—people do. (3/4)",1
"Change the people and you change how things develop; replace creators with noncreators and you stop having creations. (2/4)",1

"Having win-win relationships is obviously better than having lose-lose relationships, but they are often very difficult to have, which brings me to the prisoner’s dilemma dynamic. (5/6)",1
"In that type of lose-lose relationship they will have more destructive wars than productive exchanges. (4/6)",1
"If they choose to have a lose-lose mutually threatening relationship they will primarily think about how they can hurt the other in the hope of forcing the other into a position of fear in order to get what they want. (3/6)",1
"In that type of win-win relationship, they can have tough negotiations done with respect and consideration, competing like two friendly merchants at a bazaar or two friendly teams at the Olympics. (2/6)",1
"If they choose to have a primarily win-win cooperative-competitive relationship, they must take into consideration what is really important to the other and try to give it to them in exchange for them reciprocating. #changingworldorder #principleoftheday (1/6)",1
"And they can't escape the responsibility of making sure that their costs are acceptable and their goals are being met. Even if a person's job is unique, someone needs to be holding them accountable at all times. (2/2)",1
"Even a company's owners have bosses, in their case, the investors whose money is being spent to achieve their goals. If the owners are self-funded, they still have to make their clients and employees happy. #principleoftheday (1/2)",1
"As an example, structure their deals so that they do well or badly based on how well or badly you do in the areas they are responsible for. This is fundamental for good management. (6/6)",1
"Only the ultimate RP can do that.

When putting someone in a position of responsibility, make sure their incentives are aligned with their responsibilities and they experience the consequences of the outcomes they produce. (5/6)",1
"This is especially true when it comes to money. If you delegate the oversight responsibility for your finances to others, they typically won't hold themselves as accountable for your money as they would their own and they won't fire themselves if they are doing a bad job. (4/6)",1
"Or if you were building a house, would you go to an architect and say ""show me the kinds of houses I can build"" or would you tell the architect what kind of house you want to live in? (3/6)",1
"For example, while you might choose to delegate the responsibility of figuring out how to handle your illness to a doctor, it is your responsibility to pick the right one, since you will bear the consequences if he does a bad job. (2/6)",1

"The perfect Christmas present.

KUBA Corporation manufactured the Komet Imperial Home Entertainment System.from 1957 to 1962 in Wolfenbuttel, West Germany.

The Komet was the complete Home Entertainment Center for its time. Opening the door of the lower cabinet revealed the rest of its multi-media features.

The early models usually came with a pull-out, 4-speed Telefunken phonograph on the left, and a television tuner in the center which received both UHF and VHF signals, the Telefunken multi-band radio receiver on the right picked up AM, FM, SW and LW frequencies. 

KUBA also released models that featured a storage shelf, commonly used as a small bar or to store vinyl record albums, or for an additional charge, you could order a magneto-phone wire recorder. Wire recorders were the forerunners to reel-to-reel and cassette audio recorders.

The top cabinet or ""Sail"" had eight speakers; six speakers on the top of the sail and two horn speakers pointing forward located beneath the main console.",1

Failing to accept being blind, people with Anton syndrome dismiss evidence of their condition and employ confabulation to fill in the missing sensory input. It is named after the neurologist Gabriel Anton.

"The ampersand is a logogram that represents the conjunction ""and"". 

The ampersand can be traced back to the first century CE, when it was first used in Old Roman cursive as a ligature (a combination of two or more letters) of the letters ""E"" and ""T,"" which is short for the Latin word ""et,"" meaning ""and."" Over time, the ampersand evolved into a more elaborate and stylized form, eventually becoming the symbol we know today.

One of the earliest examples of the ampersand can be found in the Latin poem The Aeneid, written by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BCE. In the poem, the ampersand appears as a ligature of the letters ""E"" and ""T,"" and it is used to represent the word ""et.""

The ampersand became more widely used in the Middle Ages, when it was included in the Latin alphabet as a 27th letter. It was common for students to recite the alphabet with the ampersand at the end, saying ""X, Y, Z, and per se and,"" meaning ""and by itself and."" This phrase eventually became corrupted to ""ampersand,"" and the name stuck.

The ampersand continued to evolve throughout the centuries,  and interestingly, despite being excluded from the standard English alphabet, the ampersand has persisted in modern typography and design being used in logos, titles, and branding.",1

"Only obsessive readers can become great writers.

By reading, you develop your taste. You train your mind to tell good books from bad. And above all, you cultivate a vision of what writing should be.

Over time, you become less and less satisfied with what's out there. This dissatisfaction is good. It's a signal that there are rich stories trapped inside you, struggling to break free.

Finally you're forced to open the word document yourself, and start writing.

 As C.S. Lewis put it:

""I wrote the books I should have liked to read. That's always been my reason for writing. People won't write the books I want, so I have to do it for myself.""

"AI (centralizing technology) VS Web3 (decentralizing technology):

After @OpenAI it's become clear that no company wants to let their data be scraped for free.

This is leading many large platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) to start putting up walled gardens.

In the future, the most popular LLMs will be built by companies who have the most training data available. 

If we continue down this path, the only companies that will be able to gather/afford enough data will be the big tech monopolies.

AI becomes stronger the more centralized it gets, which is exactly why we need Web3 as a counterweight.

Think of public blockchains as the last bastion of the open internet. 

These are permissionless databases that anybody can access, regardless of whether you are a tech monopoly or an indie hacker.

Far into the future, these public blockchains won't be viewed as silly speculative bubbles...

Instead, they will be the digital version(s) of the Library of Alexandria.",1

"I wrote about it a little a couple of years ago: brianbalfour.com/quick-takes…

My thoughts at the time copied below (some of which overlap with yours):

Customer Feedback - Customers can't communicate how to invest in differentiation. Advances in differentiators aren't obvious. Customers in feedback will reach for the quickest solution they can think of in their mind which is typically something they've seen in a competitive product or alternative (which is literally the opposite of differentiation).  They communicate weaknesses more easily than strengths. 

""The Unforseen"" - As humans we tend to gravitate to things we can visualize more clearly. Investing in differentiation often involves leaning into something where there isn't as clear of a path and we have to trust that we can create it.

Trying To Repeat Past Successes - Along the same lines of doing what we know and can see is that product teams try to repeat what was successful in their past companies. Differentiation changes with every situation.

The Gravitational Pull of Competitors - Be careful who you name as competitors internally. Teams will tend to pay attention to them and we tend to gravitate towards the things we pay attention to. One of the hardest product strategy questions to decipher is when to copy and when to ignore.

Depth Is Hard - Investing in differentiators requires you to go deeper on some vector than anyone else. Depth is just plain hard. Requires commitment, focus, solving problems others haven't, and so much more.",1
"Thank you so much, very much appreciated.

Some simple answers:

1. So many things have been done, it's hard to have something unique, in any field, art or science.

2. Thinking of something new is a creative and inspired act, as opposed to thinking of things you can already see.  You cannot force creativity or inspiration to happen.

3. Many ideas that are different, are in fact worse, which is why people aren't doing them. You need something different.... and also good.  Much harder.

4. Different on a small scale isn't so hard (e.g. the exact visual design). But here you mean different on a large scale.  It's not even clear what the choices are.

5. There's often no way to know whether you're right, until you're fully invested.  I know, ""iterate and learn,"" but for large strategic decisions, that doesn't necessarily work.  So, also it takes confidence and guts to do a very different, very large thing. That's rare too.

"GPT4 and GPT3.5 can both track a chess game indefinitely deep into the game, if data is presented to them in a specific way. The moves produced are sometimes very high quality, and draws can be obtained at low rates against Stockfish 8(With the help of an external program coded by GPT4 that produces more detailed natural language descriptions, than shown in the examples. SF8 runs on a single core with 0.5 seconds to think, 16MB hash).

The insight from this is that GPT based language models appear to have a ""logic core"", that can be ""activated"" when you express information to them in some exact representations. 

There is some evidence that these representations are tailored to both the topic at hand, but also, the way in which the model specifically learned certain logic/common sense, which is where its static ""encoded intelligence"" comes from. It seems some types of logic are specifically learned and can only be accessed by presenting data to the model in a specific order, and specific format. This is likely due to statistical reasons pertaining to the percentage of certain formats in the training data.

When presented in the exact format as shown in these screenshots, both GPT3.5 and GPT4 can reason on a chess game regardless of where in the game it is. This means, that it can be said with relatively high confidence that the models are reasoning on information -not- in their training data, due to the exponentially larger amount of chess games possible, than the actual amount of games that have ever been posted on the internet, and thus could be in the training data. 

Since chess has specific rules and a complete information state space, it is highly likely, that there is true reasoning on novel information, when it processes these chess games below. In the chat presented in the 3rd image, I regenerated the response 17 times to see if GPT3.5 would hallucinate about the game board, but every move was valid and a decent move. Other times, in other chats, hallucinations occur, but can be corrected by letting the model know that it made an illegal move, and showing it the information from the original prompt, from the line starting with ""FEN: "". In my testing this works the majority of the time in less than 3 tries, and it happens much more often with GPT3.5. I encourage others to test this exact format and see if it fails in other chess games. I will post my findings with code, in about a week. I will demonstrate more detailed prompts to get the models to play better, and provide examples of games where a draw occurred against SF8.

I have debated releasing this understanding of GPT models, which I have had a hunch about since December, as it could help bad actors potentially use the models available today, to do things that could be harmful. This type of method, depending on the topic, can be used to get even more general purpose use out of the models currently available.  That said, this should at least give some people, a clearer understanding of what humans could be dealing with, in terms of pure encoded cognition, if more moree advanced models are trained and released. 

I don't believe anyone at OAI knows about this exact phenomenon, as a recent paper on model debates increasing performance on some tasks, included chess, and the tests were only done to move 14. Move 14 is where the models begin to wildly hallucinate on both the board state, and the legality of moves. This would only likely be chosen as a cutoff, if the researchers who authored the paper(no offense meant whatsoever), did not have a full understanding of how chess is processed by these models. Note: With the prompt I've shown here, it does occur, in some chats, that the understanding the model expresses of the board state, is erroneous, but the move it chooses is still decent. This in itself may be able to be improved.

"Did you know? 

Tennis balls used to be black and white, but changed to yellow for TV viewers thanks to David Attenborough's suggestion.

Older tennis fans will no doubt remember the days of white tennis balls, but those born after a certain date might not be aware that the sport didn’t always use yellow balls.

When lawn tennis was introduced in the late 1800s, either white or black tennis balls were used and they continued to use it until the 1970s.

And here is David Attenborough’s contribution to tennis: yellow tennis balls, which look better on colour TV, were the idea of the legendary broadcaster and naturalist when he was Controller of BBC2 in 1967. 

He had the job of introducing colour. He had been asking the government over and over again and they wouldn’t allow that, until suddenly they said, ‘Yes, OK, you can have it, and what’s more you’re going to have it in nine months’ time'.

It didn’t too long to set the wheels in motion as the BBC broadcast Wimbledon in colour for the first time during the summer of 1967.

However, the sport continued to use white tennis balls, but the introduction of colour television meant it was harder for viewers to pick up the flight of the white ball or when it clipped the white lines.

This forced the International Tennis Federation to look at alternative colours and they approved fluorescent yellow known as “optic yellow” in 1972, but it took Wimbledon another 14 years before they finally saw the light.

And that’s how tennis changed from white balls to yellow, although some believe the colour is green, but let’s not open that can of worms.",1
"Amorphophallus paeoniifolius is also known as the elephant foot yam. In Indonesia is called the pongapong flower. 

The stigmas of the female flowers will be receptive on the first day of the bloom, when the pungent smell draws pollinating insects inside, and the inflorescence closes, trapping them for a night to allow the pollen deposited on the insect to be transferred to the stigmas.

Later in the second day, the female flower is no longer receptive to pollens, the male flowers start to bloom, and the inflorescence opens again.

"Trust is the bridge between the known & unknown. It is the remarkable force that pulls us over the gap between certainty & uncertainty. When we tolerate rather than resist the unknown, we can keep moving forward during times of uncertainty.",1
"At times of uncertainty, there is something vital here we shouldn't squander: an opportunity to learn how to tolerate the unknown. That is the very essence of trusting yourself.",1
"What is so confronting about the current state of uncertainty is a daily reminder that much of life is beyond our control. Here's how we should #rethink uncertainty (a thread)...",1
"So here's my - and, maybe, your - sole resolution for 2021: stop mistaking speed for brilliant efficiency.

And, instead, embrace the positive impact of slowing down.

Read more about the process of slow in this week’s #Rethink newsletter.

"Slow allows us to think in unstructured, unconventional ways.

Slow allows us to enjoy the steps in the process, not just the end goals.

Slow allows deep, trusting relationships to form.

"Your identity can hold you back:

-I'm terrible with directions.
-I have a sweet tooth.
-I'm bad at math.

...or build you up:

-I'm the type of person who doesn't miss workouts.
-I finish what I start.
-I read every day.

Build habits that reinforce your desired identity.",1
"There is a difference between moving fast and rushing.

You can move fast and be thoughtful. When you rush, you sacrifice thoughtfulness.

Conversely, when you are thoughtful but not moving fast, you are overthinking it. Procrastination in disguise.

Don’t rush, but don’t wait.",1

Just because it didn’t work doesn’t mean it was the wrong choice.

Maybe you get a bad hop. Maybe the other guy makes a great play.

Good decisions can have bad outcomes. The world is full of probabilities, not certainties.",1
"To prioritize the day, think about the decade:

If I want to be on track to achieve that in 10 years, what do I need to do today?",1
"Love how @JamesClear talks about forming better habits:

“If you show up at the gym 5 days in a row—even for 2 minutes—you're casting votes for your new identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You're focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.”",1
"Alright, after two chapters I understand the hype.

@JamesClear articulates a lot of little things I've noticed or half-thought but never consciously defined. 

I have pretty good habits formed by my identity as a diligent person... time to keep refining with this guide 💪",1

"One of the only true shortcuts in life is finding an expert and apprenticing under them.",1
"I rarely feel rushed when I am working on the most important thing.

The act of making progress on what matters—even if it's small—is calming.

It's such a simple idea: Simply do the most important thing first and you rarely feel like you don't have enough time for what matters.",1
"1. Do great work.

5. Host events and meet in-person.
6. Become friends.
7. Rise together.",1
"When considering a new project or opportunity, one of the first questions to ask is, “How do I want to spend my days?”

Make as few choices as possible that violate your answer.

Many opportunities seem exciting but actually give you less of the life you want.",1
"There are two forms of mental toughness: loud and quiet.

Loud = Grit in extreme moments, pushing through great challenges.

Quiet = Reliability in normal moments, showing up even when it’s easy to bail.

Loud gets the press. Quiet wins the trophies.",1

The greater the threat to our self-concept, the more we try to protect ourselves with self-justification.",1
"A sneaky little “but” or an “if” added-on can turn an apology into an excuse.

“I’m sorry, but you need to understand…”",1
"The toughest kind of “I’m sorry” to say can be when the other person can’t see their contribution to the problem.

Blame-reversal apologies, however, can do more harm than good when it comes to trust.",1

"Back in January, a single LinkedIn post of mine got over 300k likes: more engagement than everything I’d posted before it, combined. And while I’m not entirely sure why, I do know it wouldn’t have happened without an incredible amount of persistence.

It was a solidly written post, about maintaining work/life balance, but was it 20x better than anything else I’d posted? Absolutely not.

See, social media is a little bit like geological erosion: 99% of the progress takes place in 1% of the time. In geology, that means earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, or a rock that’s been cracking for 1500 years finally breaking loose. In media, it means the right message got in front of the right people, when they were in the right mood, and had the time and means to share it.

One message in 100 might hit that overlap, but it’s nearly impossible to know which one. So you create 100 messages, and treat each one as if it’s your best shot.

This is true beyond social media. If you want to know which version of your product or which promo campaign is going to be a hit, make 50 different versions and watch what happens.

It’s not rocket science, but it’s also not a slot machine. There’s a real skill in maximizing your odds and fine-tuning your strategy. But no strategy will work without persistence.

I think Hubspot having a unified data layer, i.e. all the apps sitting on one database, best positions them to take advantage of LLMs. LLMs are good at doing mundane tasks, not complex tasks.

It is also called, “The Tree Of Life”, because it serves as a source of life to the animals and the community that lives around it. 80% of its trunk consists of water and it can hold up to 4,500 liters, making it a water source for the community and the animals.

Elephants eat the bark. Baboons eat the fruit. Leaves can also be eaten. Birds, bees, fruit bats and bush babies nest in the tree. Humans use the dried fruit powder in drinks, as a source of vitamins, antioxidants and minerals. The bark can be used to make rope, baskets, mats, cloth and paper.

It also holds a spiritual significance for African people. In ancient times, leaders and elders would hold meetings under huge baobab trees, to discuss important matters. They believed that the spirit of the baobab would help them make wise decisions.",1

Caesar described these horses of Belgium as ""rustic, hard and tireless"", and recommended them for use in heavy cavalry units. The early type was used by many later Roman emperors for military applications.

"Burnout is being overwhelmed by work. Boreout is being underwhelmed by work.

Data: having too much to do is exhausting, but having too little to do is demoralizing. In idle time, motivation wanes.

Sustaining energy depends on balancing what's meaningful with what's manageable.",1
"Informed optimism doesn’t mean you only look at the bright side. It means you don’t overlook the bright side.

If you won't see possibility, you can't solve problems. If you can't imagine a best case, you don't make things better.

The greatest antidote to fear is grounded hope.",1
"There's a difference between promoting yourself and promoting your work.

Promoting yourself is flaunting what you achieve in an effort to get attention. ""I'm amazing!""

Promoting your work is sharing what you create in an effort to make a contribution. ""I hope this adds value""",1
"The time people spend building personal brands would be better invested in personal connections.
 
Products have brands. People have relationships and reputations.

Authenticity is not about marketing yourself to create an image. It’s about aligning your actions with your values.",1
"Writing is more than a vehicle for communicating ideas. It's a tool for crystallizing ideas.

Writing exposes gaps in your knowledge and logic. It pushes you to articulate assumptions and consider counterarguments.

One of the best paths to sharper thinking is frequent writing.",1
"This",1
"We spend too much time trying to change people's minds and too little energy aiming to open them.

Changing minds assumes they're wrong. You're pushing them to accept your views.

Opening minds assumes there's more to learn. You're inviting them to question their views.",1
"When people are down, they don't want to hear ""Cheer up!"" Pushing them to be positive invalidates their emotions.

They don't want to be told how to feel. They want to know you care about how they feel.

The goal isn't always to feel better. Sometimes it's just to be understood.",1
"If at first you don’t succeed, you get a healthy reminder that nothing worth pursuing comes easily.

Rapid success rarely comes outside your comfort zone. If you hit your goal on the first try, you may be aiming too low.

Falling short is a sign that you're challenging yourself.",1
"One of the reasons so many problems go unsolved is that people don't like the solution.

Solution aversion is the tendency to ignore something broken when you're not a fan of the proposed fix.

The first step in solving a problem is building consensus that it exists—and matters.",1
"Self-care is not the opposite of compassion. It's the opposite of self-neglect.

Self-neglect is sacrificing yourself to serve others. Self-care is making sure that helping others doesn't hurt you.

Setting boundaries doesn't mean you're self-centered. It means you're self-aware.",1
"What’s the best piece of advice that you’ve ever received?",1
"A key skill of emotional intelligence is being slow to take offense and quick to take feedback.

People are rarely criticizing you. They're critiquing a snapshot of your words or actions.

They won't see the full you. You can still learn from their reactions to that image of you.",1
"In consensus cultures, arguments are attacks on sacred beliefs. People take offense at dissent and dismiss those who dare to disagree.

In learning cultures, arguments are tools to sharpen ideas. People invite dissent to enrich their thinking and agree to keep disagreeing.",1
"The hallmark of an open mind is not letting your ideas become your identity.

If you define yourself by your opinions, questioning them is a threat to your integrity.

If you see yourself as a curious person or a lifelong learner, changing your mind is a moment of growth.",1
"Appealing to fear isn't going to end the pandemic.

Repeatedly sounding the alarm has put us through a form of exposure therapy—we’ve built up antibodies against fear.

The last thing we need is a population too bored to pay attention and take action.

"For that reason, our protocol is for the student to be open-minded first. Once the student has taken in what the teacher has to offer, both student and teacher will be better prepared to untangle and explore the student's perspective. (3/4)",1
"That's backward. While untangling the student's thinking can be helpful, it is typically difficult and time-consuming and puts the emphasis on what the student sees instead of on what the teacher wants to convey. (2/4)",1

"Think about people's believability, which is a function of their capabilities and their willingness to say what they think. Keep their track records in mind. (4/4)",1
"The dilemma you face is trying to understand as accurately as you can what's true in order to make decisions effectively while realizing many of the opinions you will hear won't be worth much, including your own. (3/4)",1
"The best way to make great decisions is to know how to triangulate with other, more knowledgeable people. So be discerning about whom you triangulate with and skilled in the way you do it. (2/4)",1
"While it pays to be open-minded, you also have to be discerning. Remember that the quality of the life you get will depend largely on the quality of the decisions that you make as you pursue your goals. #principleoftheday (1/4)",1
"I will do the first of these in the following article and the second in a week or two: linkedin.com/pulse/two-part-… (2/2)",1

"The Quinta da Regaleira is a beautiful and mysterious palace located in Sintra, Portugal. 

It was built in the early XX century by Carvalho Monteiro, a wealthy Portuguese businessman, and designed by Luigi Manini, an Italian architect. The palace is known for its unique architecture and the stunning gardens that surround it.

The gardens are full of hidden tunnels, secret passageways, and enigmatic symbols. They are a perfect example of the Romantic style of architecture and landscape design that was popular in Europe at the time. The gardens are also home to a series of underground tunnels and caves, which add to the mysterious atmosphere of the place.

The most intriguing features of the Quinta da Regaleira are its Initiation Wells: deep, spiraling staircases that lead down into the earth. 

They better resemble underground towers lined with stairs. These wells never served as water sources. Instead, they were purportedly used for ceremonial purposes. The tunnels described above connect these wells to one another, in addition to various caves and other monuments located around the park.

Carvalho Monteiro was possibly an initiate of the Knights Templar, a Catholic military order. It is believed that initiations at Quinta da Regaleira began with blindfolded candidates entering one of the wells. 

They purportedly held a sword close to their heart and descended the 9 flights of stairs. Once they reached the bottom of the well, they walked into a dark labyrinth and needed to find their way up towards the light then to the chapel, where they were welcomed into the brotherhood.",1

"Tucked in the residential Roman neighborhood of EUR, a sprawling 1:250 scale model displays the glory of ancient Rome. 

Known as the Plastico di Roma Imperiale, it was created by archaeologist Italo Gismondi and it took 35 years to be completed.

It depicts Rome in the IV century CE at the time of Constantine I. It now sits in the Museum of Roman Civilization.

In order to replicate the layout of ancient Rome, Gismondi used Rodolfo Lanciani’s Forma Urbis Romae which was published in 1901. Lanciani’s map was based on a massive marble map of the ancient city created under the reign of Septimius Severus between 193 and 211 CE. 

However, the peak of Roman civilization took place under Constantine I in the IV century (306 – 337 CE).

The Forma Urbis Romae provided a partial geography of the city. So, Gismondi had to probe further to reveal how Rome looked like in the IV century. He worked on the scale model for over 35 years before he finally completed the Plastico di Roma Imperiale.

Gismondi continued to expand and add touches to the plaster model until it was finally completed in 1971. The scale model was built on a scale of 1:250 and it measures 55 feet by 55 feet. 

It now considered one of the most important references for how ancient Rome looked.",1

'Be' comes from being and 'lief' comes from the Indo-European word leubh, which means – love.

So a belief is literally to be in love with our version of reality.",1

Here's the problem:
* Most people don’t know or understand their own motives.
* Understanding the motives of others is incredibly difficult.",1

I was wrong.

That was hard.

It’s a small way to counter a culture  so focused on being right. 

And now they’re saying it back...",1
"The scarcest resource in life is not time, energy, or love. It's attention.

Succumbing to distractions is a decision to lower your cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence.

Concentration is a precious commodity. Your most important priorities deserve your undivided focus.",1
"There's nothing wrong with being wrong. To err is human.

It becomes a problem when you choose to stay wrong. To deny error is willful blindness.

New information is an invitation to question old opinions. The faster you are to recognize your mistakes, the less wrong you become.",1
"If you don't put having fun on your calendar, it may not happen. But if you schedule it, it's less fun.

13 studies: planning leisure reduces excitement & enjoyment by making it feel like work.

It helps to schedule it roughly—within a few-hour window instead of at an exact time.",1
"The holidays shouldn’t be a time to recharge. They should be a time to celebrate.

If work is exhausting people to the point that they’re using their time off to recover, you might have a burnout culture.

A healthy organization doesn’t leave people drained in the first place.",1
"Culture isn't slogans on the wall or ping pong tables in the hall. It’s a set of shared values that people fight to protect and promote.

Values aren't the ideals people claim to hold. They’re the principles people uphold when they decide what behaviors get rewarded and punished.",1
"Leaders who fail to listen ultimately find themselves surrounded by silence.

You don't get chosen to take charge unless you give good answers. You won't be able to make change unless you ask good questions.

Learning depends on making it safe for people to tell you the truth.",1
"When you see what people have achieved, you can figure out what they do.
When you see what they've sacrificed, you begin to understand who they are.

How you choose to spend your time reflects what motivates you.
What you're willing to give up reveals what matters to you.",1
"In toxic relationships, one person is always taking and the other is constantly giving.

In healthy relationships, both people give and receive with no strings attached.

They grant each other the freedom to ask without shame, accept without obligation, and decline without guilt.",1
"When leaders are aggressive and combative, people stop helping each other.

8 studies, 147k people: dominant leadership teaches people that success is a zero-sum game, motivating taking rather than giving.

Cutthroat competition at the top undermines collaboration across levels.",1
"Many people see grief as pain. They avoid it, suppress it, or race to process it so they can expel it from their lives.

Here’s a beautiful alternative: grief is unexpressed love.

Holding onto it is a way of staying close to the people we’ve lost.",1
"It takes humility to consider information that contradicts your opinions. You're willing to concede that you might be wrong.

It takes curiosity to actively seek evidence that challenges your views. You're eager to find out if you might be wrong.",1
"A sign of intellect is the ability to change your mind in the face of new facts.

A mark of wisdom is refusing to let the fear of admitting you were wrong stop you from getting it right.

The joy of learning something new eventually exceeds the pain of unlearning something old.",1
"Astrology doesn't hold up to scientific scrutiny:

1. The positions of celestial objects have no bearing on personality
2. There's no clear mechanism to explain why they would
3. So why do people keep believing? 

Research: it may be due to low intelligence and high narcissism...",1
"The events that make your blood boil reveal what matters most to you.

Anger rises when your core values are in jeopardy. With reflection, it becomes a mirror for seeing your principles more clearly.

With action, it becomes a map for making change to protect what you hold dear.",1
"Yes, masks make it harder to read emotions. But it's more of a challenge for toddlers than kids or adults—and it may have a silver lining.

New data: the more you talk to people in masks, the better you get at reading emotions in eyes.

Emotional intelligence is a learned skill.",1
"Great minds don’t think alike. They challenge each other to think differently.

The people who teach you the most are the ones who share your principles but not your thought processes.

Converging values draw you to similar questions. Diverging views introduce you to new answers.",1
"Although friends usually give better support, sometimes it's easier to open up to strangers.

New data: we hesitate to reveal our insecurities to friends to avoid the pain of being reminded of them.

True friends don't remind you of your insecurities. They help you overcome them.",1
"In cutthroat cultures, people kiss up and kick down. They protect themselves by currying favor with people in power and exploiting those without it.

In supportive cultures, people speak up and support down. They protect people without power by raising problems to those with it.",1
"It’s easy to be a critic or a cheerleader. It’s harder to be a coach.

A critic sees your weaknesses and attacks your worst self. A cheerleader sees your strengths and celebrates your best self.

A coach sees your potential and helps you become a better version of yourself.",1
"Impostor syndrome is a paradox:
-Others believe in you
-You don't believe in yourself
-Yet you believe yourself instead of them

If you doubt yourself, shouldn't you also doubt your judgment of yourself?

Whenever you’re lost in a thought or a swell of emotion, note it gently and thank your brain.

Chances are - it’ll defuse",1
"“I’m a failure” is not a helpful thought.

“I failed last time because of X, perhaps I’ll try Y this time” is a helpful thought.

Yet, most of us get lost in debating the first thought. (Heck, we don’t even realise we are trapped in rumination)",1
"There’s sort of a Darwinian selection happening inside your brain, and the most sensationalist thoughts bubble up.

I’m 100% sure of that.",1
"16/ Finally, when it comes to evoking emotions, nothing beats a good story. 

So it pays to learn what makes a good story (something I’m planning to write about soon).

Also, don’t forget that a good story has ups and downs (not just ups), so showing vulnerability and mixing wins/shortcomings always helps instead of just focusing on wins.",1
"15/ We often tend to use less emotional words simply because we’re not paying attention to the particulars of an experience. 

If we’re more mindful, to use more concrete words to convey our thoughts and feelings. 

How can you say a dish was mouthwatering if you ate it in a hurry in front of the TV?",1
"14/ Emotion-laden words are always more powerful than non-emotional words. Even for the same valence, some words are more emotional than others. 

For example, saying you ate a mouth-watering meal is always more persuasive than saying you ate a good meal.",1
"13/ However, when you have to paint a grand vision (such as pitching your company for funding), being concrete hurts, and you should go abstract. 

Instead of saying that you’re making a to-do app, tell people that you’re changing how the world organizes information.",1
"12/ When should you be concrete, v/s when you should be abstract? It depends.

When we have to paint a vivid picture of something (such as describing a new product), being concrete helps. Instead of saying “it’s a red T-shirt”, saying “it’s a beautiful, M-sized red T-shirt with white stripes, made of 100% cotton” will lead to more people buying the shirt.",1
"11/ Conversely, if you want to find out the truth, simply ask a direct question because most people are bad at deflection. 

So, when buying a house or a car, instead of asking “I hope everything is okay with this thing?”, ask “when is the last time this caused problems?”, or “how many complaints did you get about this last month?”",1

"It is estimated that around 1/4 or 1/3 of German population died during Thirty Years' War.

But this doesn't tell the whole story.

Some regions got off relatively lightly while some experienced a living hell.

Many parts of Germany lost more than 66% of population, as you can see on this map.

These were the contested regions where most campaigning took place. War, plundering, starvation and diseases utterly devastated the population there. Large armies, which were marching through these lands, had to survive by living off the land and after decades of ongoing conflict this took its toll. Marauding mercenaries mutinied and looted towns and countryside.

The 1/4 and 1/3 loss of population estimate gets mentioned a lot, but you need to realize that for some parts of Germany, it was even much worse than that.

But how did this devastation look in practice?

One of the quickest ways to find out is to just look up one of random German towns in the most devastated regions and take a look at what was going on during the Thirty Years' War, and it will probably be a lot of bad things happening in a short space of time.

For example the picturesque town of Heppenheim north of Heidelberg in the historic region of Starkenburg. Occupied by the Spaniards in 1620, then by the Swedes in 1630. Then a terrible plague struck in 1635 which killed 80% of population of the region, almost completely depopulating the surrounding countryside. In 1636 the town was sacked by marauding Polish mercenaries in Imperial service who had mutinied over lack of pay. In 1638 the Imperials themselves devastated the Starkenburg region and looted Heppenheim. In 1645 the French entered the region and mercilessly plundered the town of Heppenheim as well. However, as one French officer wrote, there ""wasn't much in it"" by that point. In 1646 the Imperials took the region back, but the French returned a year later. By the time peace came in 1648, the entire region was completely devastated.

This is just a typical story of many German towns and regions during the Thirty Years' War in the lands that suffered the most.

The most devastating was the late phase of the conflict from 1635 to 1648 when the entry of France prolonged the war in the already exhausted and war torn Germany, and you can also see this in the example of Heppenheim that I described above, where things really kicked off after 1635. It was also the most cynical part of the war as by that time, the religious issues which had ignited the war had been pacified by the Peace of Prague in 1635, after which almost all Protestant princes in Germany pulled out of the conflict. After that point it just became a geopolitical war between the Habsburgs and the Franco-Swedish alliance, which significantly prolonged the disastrous war, and let to these huge casualties.",1

"Poland is starting to build a fleet of large reactors TODAY, immediately after signing contracts.

They have this one great chance to bury Germany economically.

Germany's economy was based on large and middle-sized industrial companies running on cheap energy.

Where did that energy come from?

It came from three places: brown coal under German soil; insecure Russian pipeline natural gas; and its outstanding nuclear reactors, the world's most prolific.

Germany urged Europe to tax its own brown coal so severely that it multiplies the cost by more than four times.

So its own coal isn't cheap any more.

Russia always meant its gas to be a weapon of control. They simply turned off the flow at a time of their choosing in order to assist with launching a war. Only after the flow was stopped did the Nord Stream pipelines get blown up, locking the loss into place.

Now Germany has to buy liquefied gas from ships, including from Russia. It's much more expensive than the Russian pipeline gas used to be.

So the cheap gas is gone.

That left only nuclear for cheap energy. Germany just months ago in late 2021 had enough ultra-cheap clean nuclear electricity to power a third of its industrial sector at extremely competitive rates. Those plants would last for 50 more years at least.

But Germany shut down nuclear anyway.

Now there is nowhere for German companies to turn to get cheap industrial (read: steady, long-term contract) electricity.

German factories can't buy cheap power just from wind and solar because those energy sources can't guarantee they'll be available. And once you stabilize their power not with cheap nuclear but with expensive coal and gas, it's not cheap enough to be competitive.

Meanwhile Poland opened a new natural gas pipeline from Norway and is launching their nuclear program construction today.

This means if you're a German industrial manager looking to locate the next multi-billion investment that must purchase power for the next few decades, you can't justify placing it in Germany. But you might justify placing it in Poland to coincide with the arrival of its nuclear power.

And if you're a German small business owner, you can't get the cheap electricity that your French competitors get from their giant nuclear fleet. Might as well move over the river to France if possible, or close down if not.

Germany can still turn its nuclear fleet back on within a few years but may destroy it instead at the behest of a tiny number of ideology-poisoned politicians.

I predict that this colossal energy system shift will reverberate through the rest of this century.",1

If you want to be a better speaker, become a better storyteller.

If you want to be a better storyteller, write about great stories.

Finally, review what you wrote, so you're ready to use the stories in conversation when relevant.",1
"Another thing I noticed is that stories help people remember what matters.

Facts and numbers are boring. And, sadly, most people forget your important insights as soon as the talk ends.

But stories? People remember stories. And that helps them remember the main point too.",1
"It makes me look much smarter than I am.

It seems like I can pull out an interesting story to make a point or answer a question. And nearly any point you want to make will come alive with the right story.

But it's only because I wrote about it in detail previously.",1
"Today, before I'm about to do a podcast interview or a live event, I scroll through any articles related to what I'm talking about.

The headlines are usually enough to spark my memory of a few stories. 

When the presentation starts, I can drop a story in whenever relevant.",1
"Suddenly, I had a bunch of cool stories sitting around in my head. 

I knew them pretty well because I had spent hours reading the details of each story and writing it out in my own words. 

Now, these stories were ""at the ready"" and I could use them in conversation.",1
"I wrote about samurai archers - jamesclear.com/zanshin

And heroic scientists - jamesclear.com/luck-vs-hard-…

And productivity consultants - jamesclear.com/ivy-lee

And a bunch more.

And a funny thing happened...",1
"The happy accident that changed things for me was writing every week.

In my case, I wrote 2 articles per week for about 3 years.

And guess what? Most of my articles started with a story.",1
"Second lesson: The first thing you need if you want to be a good storyteller (and, by extension, a better public speaker) is good stories!

Seems obvious, but most people don't have tons of good stories. And they certainly can't generate them off-the-cuff.

At least, I couldn't.",1
"First lesson: People love good storytellers.

I was never a great storyteller, but I have friends who are. You probably do too. As soon they start talking, everyone is captivated or cracking up.

They have your full attention. Complete engagement.

It's what every speaker wants.",1
"How to become a better public speaker:

I've given 100+ keynotes (mostly about my book, Atomic Habits). I'm still not particularly amazing, but I've definitely improved.

And the #1 thing I did to get better was surprising and totally by accident.

Here's what happened...",1
"Success is largely the failures you avoid.

Health is the injuries you don't sustain.

Wealth is the purchases you don't make.

Happiness is the objects you don't desire.

Peace of mind is the arguments you don't engage.

Avoid the bad to protect the good.",1

ATHENS VS. LONDON

During the Classical era (the 5th and 4th centuries BC), Athens held intellect and open inquiry in high esteem, leading to the development of “philosophy,” meaning love of wisdom. Athens was also the world’s first (if restricted) democracy and has been nicknamed “the cradle of Western civilization.”

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and the largest city in Greece
- Home to Piraeus, one of the world’s largest passenger ports

Classical era:
- Largest Greek city-state
- Home of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
- Unusually open and democratic for its time

------

London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom and a global center of finance, education, and culture. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the city played a key role in abolishing slavery. Abolitionists in London won critical legislative victories, launched naval missions to free slaves in foreign seas, and ultimately altered moral norms that had persisted since the dawn of civilization.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and largest city in the UK
- Global center of finance, education, research, and culture
- One of the world’s top tourist destinations

Early 19th century:
- Capital of the vast British Empire
- Early center of abolitionism
- Thanks to the efforts of reformers in London, Britain banned the international slave trade and urged other governments to do the same
- When diplomacy failed, the Royal Navy began hunting slave ships and blockading slave-trading polities

"The amount of second-order effects arising from self-driving cars will be surprisingly large, I think. I recently reflected on it a bit, some thoughts:

- The number of cars required will decrease due to increased utilization, speeding up the transition to a fully electric fleet. 

- Car parks in the street will disappear; underground parking lots will turn into charging stations or be turned into underground buildings. 

- Road utilization will also rise since cars don’t need much distance from each other. This also increases aerodynamic efficiency out of town, allowing cars to go faster between cities at the same energy usage. Inside cities, the amount of roads will reduce to make more space for green areas, pedestrians, and bikes. Multilane roads in cities will disappear; there’ll be one efficient lane and an on/offboarding lane. 

- Surge pricing during rush hour to maximize asset utilization will cause us to spread out our working days; as collaboration is the reason you’re in an office together, some companies will completely go off-schedule. There will be a negative effect on people’s sleep rhythms – especially less wealthy people, who will use cars during low utilization times. 

- Rent-a-car companies and their dreaded service will thankfully disappear. 

- Traditional public transport won’t be able to compete with the low rates and door-to-door efficiency and will disappear (though car-sharing with multiple people similar to Uber pool will exist at exceptionally low prices). Local trains will disappear, but their routes and stations might be repurposed for autonomous cars (especially underground facilities in cities will be useful for this purpose).

- Emergency services will become more effective as the algorithm will be programmed to give them priority. Without traffic violations and fewer accidents, police departments will also have more time to focus on other types of crime. 

- Crime will reduce as effective get-away cars will not exist anymore. (All cars will have interior cameras which will likely reduce our privacy but we’ll accept it because of all the advantages it brings, except maybe in Germany.)

- The number of people dying from traffic accidents will decrease a lot, but won’t go to zero as the kinetic energy continues to exist and pedestrians can still, in some areas, access roads (though roads might be fenced for safety or go underground in cities). 

- Car safety features will be reduced, allowing for lighter and more efficient cars. 

- Driving for recreational purposes will be banned in most countries, increasing tourism to countries deep inside Africa where manual driving is still allowed, and boosting racetrack revenues (including special areas that simulate 20th century traffic situations with traffic signs and traffic lights). 

- Predictable issues will arise from a myriad of service providers requiring different apps, incompatibilities of standards, people forgetting their belongings (though this can be mitigated though sensors).",1

It's a bit of a trick question.  If I was going to bet on a first time entrepreneur, I would rather have a 25-year old first time founder than a 50-year old first time founder.  

But that's usually not the choice.  

The more frequent choice is do I want to bet on a 25 year old first time founder or a 50-year old who is on their fourth startup.  

In that case, I'll go with the 50-year old every time.

The obvious conclusion here is that experience outweighs youth by a large margin.  

I did my first startup when I was in my mid 20s and messed things up horribly.  I did a bit better on my 2nd.  

And a lot better on my third.  And with Netflix - my 5th startup - I really had confidence that I knew what I was doing.  And for Looker - #6 - and with me pushing 60, I had it pretty wired.

The most important thing here is not to let age stop you.  

If you are 25 and dreaming of starting your own company — then for god's sake start one.  

And if you are 50 and think you are too old?  Well you are not.

At -40°C the soldiers didn’t turn their backs on the poor and starving bears and cubs, but started to feed them every now and then.

Soldiers would open such a tin with a tin-opener and then give the can to the bear who licked all the milk from tin and then feed her little bears with it. Those  tins of condensed milk were the winter dessert staple of every Soviet kid.

The condensed milk (called in Russian: sgushchennoye moloko) had an indeterminately long shelf life and there was always plenty of it. It was a common dessert in the army too.

"Outdoor house cats have a wider-ranging diet than any other predator on Earth. 

Globally, house cats have been observed eating over 2,000 different species, 16% of which are endangered.

Free-ranging cats (Felis catus) are globally distributed invasive carnivores that markedly impact biodiversity. A new study developed a comprehensive global assessment of species consumed by cats.

The research identified 2,084 species eaten by cats, of which 347 (16.65%) are of conservation concern. Islands contain threefold more species of conservation concern eaten by cats than continents do. 

Birds, reptiles, and mammals constitute about 90% of species consumed, with insects and amphibians being less frequent. Approximately 9% of known birds, 6% of known mammals, and 4% of known reptile species are identified in cat diets. 

97% of species consumed are <5 kg in adult body mass, though much larger species are also eaten. 

The results demonstrate that cats are extreme generalist predators, which is critical for understanding their impact on ecological systems and developing management solutions.

"Richard ""Dick"" Lasher was on his way to drive his dirt bike when Mount St Helens erupted in May 1980.

He spent the Saturday night packing some gear figuring he would head out first thing in the morning to get a look at the mountain.

His plan was hitching his Yamaha IT enduro bike to the back of his Pinto, driving up to Spirit Lake, then exploring the area via dirt forest roads on the bike.

Lasher drove down toward Spirit Lake from the north, likely dropping down from U.S. 12 and the town of Randle into the forest roads of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. 

He possibly made it as far south as Forest Road 26 by 8:32 that morning of May 18.

The time the volcano blew.

And if he had made it to the lake, he would almost certainly have died. The sheer force of the blast lifted the lake out of its bed and propelled it about 85 stories into the air to splash onto adjacent mountain slopes.

Luckily for him, and he did not realize until later just how lucky, he was on the opposite side of that ridge in front, because the entire forest was flattened from the ridge down, and he was in the lee side and protected from most of the blast.

That's the photo: a red Ford Pinto with a blue dirt bike hitched to its bumper, angled across a forest road.",1

Irène and her husband, Frédéric Joliot, would take home their own Nobel in chemistry in 1936.

"Manhole covers are a familiar sight around the world.

But did you know that designer manhole covers in Japan are currently gaining so much attention as a new type of region-specific item/artwork, that they can cost up to $900?

Japan’s decorated manhole covers initially took shape as a public relations campaign for sewers. Beginning in the 1950s, the cast plates featured simple geometric patterns, such as the “Tokyo” and “Nagoya” designs.

Yasutake Kameda conceived the intricate, artistic versions in 1985, to help warm a skeptical rural population to the idea of the costly but necessary modernization of the country’s sewer system.

Local design manholes in Japan feature elements special to a particular location: a town emblem, landmark, event, or official bird or flower. Today an estimated 95% of Japan’s 1,718 municipalities, across all 47 prefectures, now host their own unique covers.

Typically, a designed manhole cover costs approximately $585. The color, however, is applied carefully by hand, and nearly doubles the price of a manhole to more than $900.",1

"Saint Lucy's Day is a Christian feast day observed #Today, on December 13.

It commemorates Lucia of Syracuse, an early-fourth-century virgin martyr under the Diocletianic Persecution. 

According to the legend, she brought food and aid to Christians hiding in the Roman catacombs, wearing a candle lit wreath on her head to light her way, leaving both hands free to carry as much food as possible.

Because her name means ""light"" and her feast day had at one time coincided with the shortest day of the year prior to calendar reforms, it is now widely celebrated as a festival of light.

Saint Lucy's Day is celebrated most widely in Scandinavia, Italy and the island nation of Saint Lucia.

In Scandinavia, where Lucy is called Santa/Sankta Lucia, there's certainly the most pitoreque celebration: she is represented as a woman in a white dress symbolizing a baptismal robe and a red sash symbolizing the blood of her martyrdom, with a crown of candles on her head.

She carries cookies and saffron buns in procession, which symbolizes bringing the Light of Christ into the world's darkness.

it takes energy to get value, and an animal is always (subconsciously) calculating tradeoffs between expected value and expected cost.",1
"24/ This sort of behavior is predicted by the marginal value theorem, which is a mathematical model of how much time animals spend foraging food in a patch of land.

>When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies

== TLDR ==

In a jungle with a mix of real and fake mangoes:

• Monkeys will pay extra attention to signs that remind them of real mangoes

• Monkeys will be impatient and skeptical about spending effort anywhere else (even if those directions, in theory, could have real mangoes)",1
"16/ What could be such signs of trust?

A real mango tree will have parrots near it. If there are no parrots, spending energy walking towards it is wasteful, as it’ll likely turn out to be deception.",1
"15/ In an environment full of deceptions, monkeys that are inherently skeptical will preserve their energy, while the naively trusting monkeys will waste all their energy.

"14/ (I don’t know whether such a mango-like deceptive tree exists, but nature is full of similar deceptions).

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decept…",1
"13/ Because monkeys do a valuable service for a tree, this opens the possibility for deception. 

In theory, there could be another tree in the forest that looks-and-feels like a mango tree, fooling the monkey into eating its fruit without investing in making the energy-rich sugary pulp. 

This way, the deceptive-mango tree could have the monkey spend its energy on spreading the seed without giving too much of its own valuable resources, thereby profiting an “excess profit”.",1
"12/ Such correlates of mangoes exist because mango trees want to be spotted. 

These trees invest their limited resources in making tasty mangoes because their seeds get spread when the monkey eats the fruit and shit the seed in the ground. 

Like most long-term stable associations, it’s a give and take relationship between the mango tree and the monkey.",1
"11/ But if none of these mango-reminding *signals* are bubbling up in your consciousness, you’ll possibly start a random search, but will always keep your ears and eyes open to spot either a mango tree or its *correlates*.",1
"10/ Okay, so you will likely look around, and observe which area of the forest seems like it could have a mango tree.

BOLOGNA VS. LONDON

Besides its famous contribution to the sausage world, Bologna was an early innovator in higher education. Lay students across Europe flocked to Bologna to study law under a renowned jurist known as Pepo. Facing legal discrimination, the students formed a guild known as the universitates scholarium, which evolved into the world’s first university.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- 2nd largest medieval district in Europe 
- Gastronomic capital
- Headquarters of Ducati and Lamborghini

11-15th century:
- Hosted the first university and Europe’s premier center of higher learning, with 3,000 to 5,000 students - The university created separate departments for different fields of study, set degree requirements, and awarded bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees
- First university to have a female professor

------

London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom and a global center of finance, education, and culture. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the city played a key role in abolishing slavery. Abolitionists in London won critical legislative victories, launched naval missions to free slaves in foreign seas, and ultimately altered moral norms that had persisted since the dawn of civilization.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and largest city in the UK
- Global center of finance, education, research, and culture
- One of the world’s top tourist destinations

Early 19th century:
- Capital of the vast British Empire
- Early center of abolitionism
- Thanks to the efforts of reformers in London, Britain banned the international slave trade and urged other governments to do the same
- When diplomacy failed, the Royal Navy began hunting slave ships and blockading slave-trading polities

ATHENS VS. NEW YORK

During the Classical era (the 5th and 4th centuries BC), Athens held intellect and open inquiry in high esteem, leading to the development of “philosophy,” meaning love of wisdom. Athens was also the world’s first (if restricted) democracy and has been nicknamed “the cradle of Western civilization.”

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and the largest city in Greece
- Home to Piraeus, one of the world’s largest passenger ports

Classical era:
- Largest Greek city-state
- Home of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
- Unusually open and democratic for its time

------

New York is the largest city in the United States, and its metropolitan area is among the world’s most populous megacities. After WWII, New York City assumed a new global prominence as the world’s financial capital. Today, “Wall Street” is shorthand for financial capitalism itself.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Largest city in the US
- World’s most linguistically diverse city
- Home to more billionaires than any other city
- Home to over 100 colleges and universities
- World’s most photographed city

Post WW2:
- Became international business headquarters
- Overtook Paris as the center of the art and fashion world
- Overtook London as the world’s financial capital
- Became the world’s biggest manufacturing center with the busiest port
- Developed bebop and the credit card

"5/🌇 #CentersOfProgress Tournament Quarterfinals

LONDON VS. FLORENCE

London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom and a global center of finance, education, and culture. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the city played a key role in abolishing slavery. Abolitionists in London won critical legislative victories, launched naval missions to free slaves in foreign seas, and ultimately altered moral norms that had persisted since the dawn of civilization.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and largest city in the UK
- Global center of finance, education, research, and culture
- One of the world’s top tourist destinations  

Early 19th century:
- Capital of the vast British Empire
- Early center of abolitionism
- Thanks to the efforts of reformers in London, Britain banned the international slave trade and urged other governments to do the same
- When diplomacy failed, the Royal Navy began hunting slave ships and blockading slave-trading polities

------

Renaissance Florence was at the heart of countless groundbreaking developments in politics, business, finance, engineering, science, philosophy, architecture, and—above all—artistic achievement. After growing rich from the cloth trade and innovations in banking, Florentine merchants and moneylenders financed great artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo, and da Vinci, who produced some of the world’s most exquisite works of art.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and most populous city in Tuscany
- Key center of Italian fashion industry
- Popular tourist destination

Renaissance:
- First city-state in centuries to mass produce gold coins and charge interest on loans
- Perfected double-entry bookkeeping
- Led the resurgence of humanism and classicism in Europe
- Established the basis of traditional Western art
- Produced Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello, Machiavelli, Amerigo Vespucci, Filippo Brunelleschi, and Sandro Botticelli

"The two-minute rule specifies that you have to give someone an uninterrupted two minutes to explain their thinking before jumping in with your own. #principleoftheday (1/2)",1

Writing down principles helps people learn from each other, better understand each other, and work more effectively together. (6/6)",1
"These things will bring you a happier and more successful life (5/6)",1
"...principled way. The higher you ascend, the more effective you will become at working with your realities to shape outcomes to achieve your goals, and what once seemed impossibly complex will become simple. You will understand and deal with reality better. (4/6)",1
"...for dealing with these things. You will find that by going through this process of reflecting on and writing down principles you will change your perspective and naturally “ascend” to higher and higher levels, which will lead you to see things in this more top- down... (3/6)",1
"2. You will think in a more principled way.
                                
By principled thinking, I mean observing realities from a higher level, noting that most things happen over and over again for by and large the same reasons and thinking about the principles... (2/6)",1
"If you write your principles down:

1. You will think more deeply about them

If you pause to think about your principles for dealing with the situations you are encountering, you will think much more deeply about them, which will make them better. (1/6)",1
"Too often groups will make a decision to do something without assigning personal responsibilities, so it is not clear who is supposed to follow up by doing what. Be clear in assigning personal responsibilities. #principleoftheday",1
"For example, people will sometimes say, ""I feel like (something is true)"" and proceed as though it's a fact, when other people may interpret the same situation differently. Ask them, ""Is it true?"" to ground the conversation in reality. (2/2)",1
"People's emotions tend to heat up when there is disagreement. Remain calm and analytical at all times; it is more difficult to shut down a logical exchange than an emotional one. Remember too that emotions can shade how people see reality. #principleoftheday (1/2)",1
"Topic slip is random drifting from topic to topic without achieving completion on any of them. One way to avoid it is by tracking the conversation on a whiteboard so that everyone can see where you are. #principleoftheday",1
"All you need to do is start journaling and see what comes from it.

This is one of the principles I wrote through this process. 

I developed a journal to help you create your own principles – if you’re interested, you can order it now: amazon.com/Principles-Your-G… (2/2)",1

BAGHDAD VS. BOLOGNA

9th century Baghdad was the intellectual capital of the Muslim world. For a time, Baghdad had a relatively open and tolerant society that allowed scholars of many different backgrounds to flourish and question established wisdom. Some of Baghdad's innovations include the astrolabe, spherical trigonometry, and algebra.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of Iraq
- One of the Arab world’s largest cities
- Among the most dangerous cities on Earth

Abbasid caliphate:
- Hub of commerce and scholarship with a relatively open and tolerant society
- Home of the House of Wisdom, a grand library and center of translation
- Scholars in Baghdad perfected the astrolabe, invented spherical trigonometry, algebra, and the sine quadrant, and greatly advanced the field of astronomy

------

Besides its famous contribution to the sausage world, Bologna was an early innovator in higher education. Lay students across Europe flocked to Bologna to study law under a renowned jurist known as Pepo. Facing legal discrimination, the students formed a guild known as the universitates scholarium, which evolved into the world’s first university.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- 2nd largest medieval district in Europe
- Gastronomic capital
- Headquarters of Ducati and Lamborghini

11-15th century:
- Hosted the first university and Europe’s premier center of higher learning, with 3,000 to 5,000 students
- The university created separate departments for different fields of study, set degree requirements, and awarded bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees
- First university to have a female professor

"""using up resources"" turns out to be a fundamentally wrong way to think about the world, and wealth creation.

it's really just ""rearranging atoms"".",1
"Can we have perpetual growth on a finite planet?

The answer is yes, but it's counterintuitive. Here's how:

1. Market forces. When resources become scarce, prices rise, and we adapt by increasing supply, reducing consumption, recycling, and finding substitutes (in a word, innovating). After we adapt and innovate, we usually end up with more resources than we had before.
2. We don't ""use up"" resources in any real sense. Every atom can be infinitely repurposed and rearranged, as long as we have energy and ideas.

That is why, over the long run, resources have become far more abundant.

NEW YORK VS. HONG KONG

New York is the largest city in the United States, and its metropolitan area is among the world’s most populous megacities. After WWII, New York City assumed a new global prominence as the world’s financial capital. Today, “Wall Street” is shorthand for financial capitalism itself.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Largest city in the US
- World’s most linguistically diverse city
- Home to more billionaires than any other city
- Home to over 100 colleges and universities
- World’s most photographed city

Post WW2:
- Became international business headquarters
- Overtook Paris as the center of the art and fashion world
- Overtook London as the world’s financial capital
- Became the world’s biggest manufacturing center with the busiest port
- Developed bebop and the credit card

------

In the 1960s, Hong Kong transformed from a starving, disease-ridden slum into a fabulously wealthy global city, largely due to classical liberal policies. Hong Kong’s rise exemplified the potential of limited government, the rule of law, and economic freedom, making it a critical case study in global progress.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- International center of finance and commerce
- Second highest number of billionaires in the world
- Largest number of skyscrapers of any city
- High income per capita
- Freedoms are under attack from the CCP 

Free-market transformation:
- Became one of the first cities in East Asia to industrialize
- World's freest economy for many years
- Went from one of the poorest places on the planet to one of the most prosperous
- Between 1945 and 1997, Hong Kong's average income grew from 40% of the UK's to 118%

"2/🌇 #CentersOfProgress Tournament Quarterfinals

First up, the match you’ve all been waiting for—a classic clash between the great civilizations of the Mediterranean.

ATHENS VS. ROME

During the Classical era (the 5th and 4th centuries BC), Athens held intellect and open inquiry in high esteem, leading to the development of “philosophy,” meaning love of wisdom. Athens was also the world’s first (if restricted) democracy and has been nicknamed “the cradle of Western civilization.”

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and the largest city in Greece
- Home to Piraeus, one of the world’s largest passenger ports.

Classical era:
- Largest Greek city-state
- Home of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
- Unusually open and democratic for its time

------

During the Republican and early Imperial periods, the Romans built infrastructure that was unparalleled in its sophistication. Their crowning achievement was the viae Romanae, a road network of unrivaled scale that proved crucial to unifying the vast and culturally diverse Roman territory. At the peak of Rome’s strength, the Empire contained 372 great roads, and 29 major highways radiated from Rome itself.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and largest city in Italy
- Major European center of business and tourism
- Home of the Vatican
- Unparalleled historical influence

Republican and early Imperial periods:
- Arguably the first true metropolis
- Capital of a massive polity that enforced centuries of peace
- Built exceptionally high-quality infrastructure, some of which is still in use today

EDINBURGH VS. FLORENCE

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, Edinburgh was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment—a vital period in intellectual history that emphasized common sense and empiricism. Scottish Enlightenment thinkers made breakthroughs in mathematics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, and geology and, in the cases of Adam Smith and David Hume, founded entirely new disciplines (economics and cognitive science).

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of Scotland
- Hosts the University of Edinburgh, one of Scotland’s most prestigious universities
- Home to Edinburgh Castle, Scotland’s most visited tourist attraction

Scottish Enlightenment:
- Home to a tolerant Presbyterian church
- Unusually high literacy rate for its time
- Produced James Hutton (redefined geology), Joseph Black (discovered CO2, magnesium, latent heat & specific heat), James Young Simpson (invented chloroform), James Watt (improved the steam engine), David Hume, Adam Smith, and the Encyclopedia Britannica

------

Renaissance Florence was at the heart of countless groundbreaking developments in politics, business, finance, engineering, science, philosophy, architecture, and—above all—artistic achievement. After growing rich from the cloth trade and innovations in banking, Florentine merchants and moneylenders financed great artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo, and da Vinci, who produced some of the world’s most exquisite works of art.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and most populous city in Tuscany
- Key center of Italian fashion industry
- Popular tourist destination

Renaissance:
- First city-state in centuries to mass produce gold coins and charge interest on loans
- Perfected double-entry bookkeeping
- Led the resurgence of humanism and classicism in Europe
- Established the basis of traditional Western art
- Produced Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello, Machiavelli, Amerigo Vespucci, Filippo Brunelleschi, and Sandro Botticelli

AMSTERDAM VS. LONDON

During the Dutch Golden Age (1581-1672), Amsterdam was a beacon of openness. Dutch traders brought in goods from around the world, and Amsterdam’s unusual religious tolerance made the city a haven for controversial thinkers. Amsterdam’s many innovations include the world’s first multinational corporation and stock exchange.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and most populous city in the Netherlands (but not the seat of government)
- European financial center
- Known internationally for nightlife, canals, and historic sites
- One of the world’s most multicultural cities

Dutch Golden Age:
- Refuge for Protestants and Jews fleeing Europe’s religious wars
- Embraced and courted skilled and wealthy foreigners (by 1600, one-third of Amsterdammers were foreign-born)
- Became extremely wealthy through trade and commerce
- The newly wealthy Dutch poured funds into science and art, inventing microbiology and the pendulum clock and producing beloved painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer

------

London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom and a global center of finance, education, and culture. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the city played a key role in abolishing slavery. Abolitionists in London won critical legislative victories, launched naval missions to free slaves in foreign seas, and ultimately altered moral norms that had persisted since the dawn of civilization.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of and largest city in the UK
- Global center of finance, education, research, and culture
- One of the world’s top tourist destinations

Early 19th century:
- Capital of the vast British Empire
- Early center of abolitionism
- Thanks to the efforts of reformers in London, Britain banned the international slave trade and urged other governments to do the same
- When diplomacy failed, the Royal Navy began hunting slave ships and blockading slave-trading polities

BOLOGNA VS. MAINZ

Besides its famous contribution to the sausage world, Bologna was an early innovator in higher education. Lay students across Europe flocked to Bologna to study law under a renowned jurist known as Pepo. Facing legal discrimination, the students formed a guild known as the universitates scholarium, which evolved into the world’s first university.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- 2nd largest medieval district in Europe
- Gastronomic capital
- Headquarters of Ducati and Lamborghini

11-15th century:
- Hosted the first university and Europe’s premier center of higher learning, with 3,000 to 5,000 students
- The university created separate departments for different fields of study, set degree requirements, and awarded bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees
- First university to have a female professor

------

Plagued by violence and economic problems, Mainz during the 15th century was an unlikely site of progress. However, it was also the home of Johannes Gutenberg, whose printing press spread across Europe with incredible speed thanks to a diaspora of printmakers fleeing the city’s turmoil.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- Capital of Rhineland-Palatinate, a state in western Germany
- Known for its medieval architecture

15th century:
- Politically important city in the Holy Roman Empire
- Deeply unstable thanks to tensions between nobles and merchants
- Home of Gutenberg, inventor of the printing press

Sort of like your current choices are suboptimal.

be honest with telling the story of what role product plays in a particular culture of people.",1

HONG KONG VS. HOUSTON

In the 1960s, Hong Kong transformed from a starving, disease-ridden slum into a fabulously wealthy global city, largely due to classical liberal policies. Hong Kong’s rise exemplified the potential of limited government, the rule of law, and economic freedom, making it a critical case study in global progress.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- International center of finance and commerce
- Second highest number of billionaires in the world
- Largest number of skyscrapers of any city
- High income per capita
- Freedoms are under attack from the CCP

Free-market transformation:
- Became one of the first cities in East Asia to industrialize
- World's freest economy for many years
- Went from one of the poorest places on the planet to one of the most prosperous
- Between 1945 and 1997, Hong Kong's average income grew from 40% of the UK's to 118%

------

During the 20th-century Space Race, Houston was at the center of American spaceflight. From liftoff onward, the astronauts who pushed the frontiers of science and discovery relied on Houston to ensure mission success and bring them safely home.

Quick facts

Modern day:
- 4th most populous city in the US
- Affordable metropolis with laissez-faire land management
- Busiest U.S. port by tonnage
- Hosts the world's largest rodeo

Space race:
- Home of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center and its famous Mission Control Center
- Base for astronaut training
- Every human who has been to the moon was guided there by flight controllers in Houston

ATHENS VS. ALEXANDRIA

During the Classical era (the 5th and 4th centuries BC), Athens held intellect and open inquiry in high esteem, leading to the development of “philosophy,” meaning love of wisdom. Athens was also the world’s first (if restricted) democracy and has been nicknamed “the cradle of Western civilization.”

Quick facts:

Modern day:
- Capital of and the largest city in Greece
- Home to Piraeus, one of the world’s largest passenger ports.

Classical era:
- Largest Greek city-state
- Home of Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
- Unusually open and democratic for its time

------

In the third century BC, Alexandria’s king commissioned a library intended to hold all the world’s written knowledge. The Great Library’s vast collection made Alexandria the intellectual capital of the world, attracting the brightest scholars and enabling countless discoveries.

Quick facts:

Modern day:
- 2nd largest city in Egypt and 9th largest city in Africa
- Major industrial center

Ptolemaic era:
- Largest city in the ancient world until surpassed by Rome
- Its Great Library may have held around 700,000 scrolls
- Scholars who studied in Alexandria include Archimedes, Aristarchus, Callimachus, Eratosthenes, Euclid, Herophilus, and Heron.

Vienna vs. Florence

European cultural powerhouses

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Vienna revolutionized music, producing some of the classical and romantic eras’ greatest works. Wealthy aristocratic sponsors attracted great musicians and composers to the city, including Beethoven, Brahms, Haydn, Schubert, and Mozart. Pieces composed during Vienna’s golden age still dominate orchestral performances today.

Renaissance Florence was at the heart of countless groundbreaking developments in politics, business, finance, engineering, science, philosophy, architecture, and—above all—artistic achievement. After growing rich from the cloth trade and innovations in banking, Florentine merchants and moneylenders financed great artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo, and Da Vinci, who produced some of the world’s most exquisite works of art.

Edinburgh vs. Cambridge

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, Edinburgh was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment—a vital period in intellectual history that emphasized common sense and empiricism. Scottish Enlightenment thinkers made breakthroughs in mathematics, medicine, chemistry, engineering, and geology and, in the cases of Adam Smith and David Hume, founded entirely new disciplines (economics and cognitive science).

Thanks to its rigorous academic culture and generous benefactors, Cambridge has played a pivotal role in mankind’s quest for truth and understanding. The great minds who studied or taught at Cambridge University include William Harvey, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Lord Byron, Charles Babbage, Sylvia Plath, Milton Friedman, Steven Hawking, and Charles Darwin.

Paris vs. Amsterdam

Havens of free thought

The salons and coffeehouses of 18th-century Paris hosted the philosophes who birthed the Enlightenment, a movement promoting reason, free inquiry, individual liberty, humanism, limited government, and the separation of church and state. As Paris became a global capital of philosophy, it earned the nickname “the City of Light” (“la Ville Lumière”).

During the Dutch Golden Age (1581-1672), Amsterdam was a beacon of openness. Dutch traders brought in goods from around the world, and Amsterdam’s unusual religious tolerance made the city a haven for controversial thinkers. Amsterdam’s many innovations include the world’s first multinational corporation and stock exchange.

"15/🌇 #CentersOfProgress Tournament Round 2

London vs. Philadelphia

A revolutionary rematch

London is the most populous city in the United Kingdom and a global center of finance, education, and culture. During the late 18th and early 19th century, the city played a key role in abolishing slavery. Abolitionists in London won critical legislative victories, launched naval missions to free slaves in foreign seas, and ultimately altered moral norms that had persisted since the dawn of civilization.

Nicknamed the “cradle of liberty,” Philadelphia was the headquarters of the American Revolution and the home of Independence Hall, where the founding fathers signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution. The ideas at the heart of the new form of government proved so successful that today, representative liberal democracies have replaced autocracies throughout much of the world.

"The Pantheon, Rome

Built on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BCE – 14 CE), it was ordered by the emperor Hadrianand completed in 126 CE.

Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple: M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIVM·FECIT

It has a coffered concrete dome, with a central opening (oculus) to the sky, allowing rainfall through the ceiling and onto the floor. Because of this, the interior floor is equipped with drains and has been built with an incline of about 30 centimetres (12 in) to promote water runoff.

According to various studies and historians, the Pantheon functions as a giant spherical sundial: throughout the day, light from the oculus moves around in a reverse sundial effect, marking time with light rather than shadow.

Possibly the most interesting engineering feature, the  unreinforced concrete dome survived the fall of an empire. Nearly 2,000 years later, nobody has ever built a bigger one: it still is the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world.

The structure has a diameter of 43.3 meters (142 feet), which is exactly the same as its height, creating a perfectly balanced and visually stunning design. The dome's construction technique, using lighter aggregate materials in the upper layers to reduce weight, has allowed it to stand the test of time, making it a true testament to the ingenuity of Roman architects and builders.

The secret of its longevity sits in the Roman concrete: produced with calcium carbonate lumps called ""lime clasts"", these were previously thought to be the result of poorly mixed concrete, but are now understood to provide ""self-healing"" properties. Water seeping in through cracks in the concrete has been shown to dissolve the calcium carbonate, creating a solution which then recrystallizes to plug the gaps.

An authentic jewel of the ancient engineering.",1
"A new ocean is forming in Africa along a 35-mile crack that opened up in Ethiopia in 2005. The crack, which has been expanding ever since, is a result of three tectonic plates pulling away from each other. 

It’s thought that Africa’s new ocean will take at least 5 million to 10 million years to form, but the Afar region’s fortuitous location at the boundaries of the Nubian, Somali and Arabian plates makes it a unique laboratory to study elaborate tectonic processes.

There are still some big unknowns, including what is causing the continent to rift apart. Some think that a massive plume of superheated rocks rising from the mantle beneath East Africa could be driving the region’s continental rift.

Each plate boundary in the Afar region is spreading at different speeds, but the combined forces of these separating plates is creating what’s known as a mid-ocean ridge system, where eventually a new ocean will form.

The three plates are separating at different speeds. The Arabian plate is moving away from Africa at a rate of about 1 inch per year, while the two African plates are separating even slower, between half an inch to 0.2 inches per year.

"Harrison Okene, the man who survived 60 hours in a capsized boat at the bottom of the sea.

In May 2013, Okene, a 29-year-old cook from Nigeria, was working on a tugboat. The boat was moving through stormy waters when a huge wave slammed into the vessel, causing it to capsize and sink 20 miles off the coast of Nigeria.

The boat came to a rest upside down on the sea bottom, at a depth of 30 m (98 ft).

Eleven crew members died, but in total darkness, Okene found himself trapped in an air pocket within the upturned vessel. 

There, he fabricated a platform from a mattress and other materials which kept the upper part of his body above water that helped reduce heat loss.

This air pocket became his lifeline.

Three days after the accident, Okene was discovered by South African divers, Nicolaas van Heerden, Darryl Oosthuizen and Andre Erasmus, employed to investigate the scene and recover the bodies.

The rescuing divers fitted Okene with a diving helmet so he could breathe while being transferred into a closed diving bell and returned to the surface for decompression from saturation. 

Okene lost consciousness during the transfer, but survived and he's today considered an accidental aquanaut.",1

"A ship that disappeared five hundred years ago was found in a desert in southwest Africa with two thousand pure gold coins and tens of thousands of pounds of copper ingots.

On 7 March 1533, the Bom Jesus set sail from Lisbon. It was part of a fleet of Portuguese carracks, laden with naval equipment and precious goods for trade and exchange, bound for western India where they would pick up valuable pepper and spices.

Just four months into the 15-month journey, the fleet was caught in a violent storm as it rounded the southern tip of Africa.

Its destiny remained unknown until 2008, when workers mining for diamonds on the coast of Namibia discovered the remains of a ship in a cofferdam.

Excavations revealed that much of the ship’s structure and over 40 tons of its cargo survived intact, well-preserved for almost 500 years by the cold waters caused by the Benguela ocean current. Among the artefacts recovered were thousands of copper ingots and gold and silver coins, which proved to be key to identifying the ship as the Bom Jesus.

But another discovery, of perhaps even greater significance, was the presence of more than 100 elephant tusks, the largest archaeological cargo of African elephant ivory ever found.

Today, the Bom Jesus is the oldest known and most valuable shipwreck ever discovered off the Western coast of Sub-Saharan Africa.",1

It is part of the Izu-Tobu volcano group, which is a chain of volcanoes that stretches from the Izu Peninsula to the Izu Islands. Mount Omuro is a stratovolcano, which means it is made up of layers of hardened lava, volcanic ash, and tephra. This type of volcano is known for its explosive eruptions, and Mount Omuro is no exception.

It is about 4,000 years old and has been dormant for centuries. The last known eruption was in 1492, and since then, the volcano has been quiet. However, the area around Mount Omuro is still active, with several hot springs and fumaroles.

One of the most interesting geological features of Mount Omuro is its crater. The crater is about 300 meters in diameter and is surrounded by a 15-meter-high rim. The crater is accessible by a chairlift, and visitors can walk around the rim and enjoy the stunning views of the surrounding area.

It is a popular tourist destination, and visitors can enjoy a variety of activities, including hiking, archery, and paragliding. The mountain is also famous for its annual burning of the grass on its slopes, a tradition that dates back over 700 years.",1

Its unusual longevity was first noticed in 1972 by reporter Mike Dunstan.
