"Klaus Schwab says that through, ""Prescriptive Programming"", elections won't be necessary in the future...

To understand what he meant, two upcoming productions - a movie titled ""Civil War"" and a documentary ""God And Country"" give us a clue.

These pieces, launching before the pivotal 2024 elections, seem to be more than mere entertainment. 

They appear to be chess pieces in a grander game of social and political influence, a game that some theorize is akin to what might be called ""prescriptive programming.""

Let's start with the film ""Civil War."" Picture this: a trailer showcasing a society torn apart by right-wing extremism, journalists cast as the valiant truth-seekers and defenders of democracy. 

The narrative is potent, timely, and, for some, deeply concerning. It's a storyline that seems to fit snugly into the prevailing winds of political discourse, reinforcing certain narratives while subtly undermining others.

Then there's ""God And Country,"" a documentary poised to take a critical look at Christian Nationalism. 

In a nation where faith and politics often intertwine in complex and sometimes controversial ways, this film promises to add fuel to an already blazing fire of debate and discussion.

These productions aren't merely isolated cultural artifacts; they are potential catalysts in an era where media content is increasingly viewed through the lens of political impact and psychological influence. 

This perspective recalls a speculative concept mentioned by Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. 

In a discussion about the future impact of AI, Schwab mused on technology's evolution from analytical to predictive, and possibly to prescriptive capabilities. 

Schwab's musings and these upcoming media releases form a curious mosaic. 

These films, with their charged themes and timely releases, seem to embody the essence of the concept of ""Prescriptive Programming"" - media content that might be seen as prescribing a certain viewpoint or attitude towards contemporary political and social issues.

The idea that media can influence public opinion isn't novel. What's intriguing here is the alignment of these filmic narratives with broader societal and political currents, particularly as America approaches a critical election. 

It's not about overt propaganda; it's more subtle, a shaping of the cultural milieu, a gentle nudging of public consciousness in a direction that aligns with certain ideologies or perspectives.

In dissecting these developments, one must tread the line between skepticism and open-mindedness. 

It's easy to veer into the realm of conspiracy theories, but it's equally naive to dismiss the profound impact media can have on public perception and opinion. 

These films, irrespective of their artistic merit or intent, are poised to become part of the larger conversation about media's role in shaping not just culture, but also the political landscape.

As the world gears up for the releases of ""Civil War"" and ""God And Country,"" it's worth pondering the power of media in our lives. 

Are these productions mere reflections of our times, or are they tools subtly sculpting the contours of our societal and political understanding?"

"🚨🚨HUGE BREAKING: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has just DENIED former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' request to move his trial from Georgia State Court to Federal Court.

Meadows was hoping, among other things, to get a jury more favorable to him. His only hope now is to take his appeal to the Supreme Court.

How does this news make you feel?"
"A whole lot of people were saying we were going to be in a recession by now, and they got it very wrong.

President Biden's policies not only kept us from a recession, they've allowed the economy to THRIVE.

A whole lot of people owe our President an apology."
"CLEAN AIR IS NOT ""WOKE"":

Imagine being the governor of a state, and thinking that stoking an irrational fear of ""wokeness"" is more important than responsible action on clean air for your residents.

Ron DeSantis has, once again, failed Florida residents in an ill-advised bid to make a misguided political statement.

Incredibly, Florida is the sole state that rejected millions aimed at reducing emissions. In 2021, Congress allocated $6.4 billion to combat tailpipe emissions and address climate change impacts across states.  

Among the recipients, Florida was earmarked to receive $320 million, ranking as the third-highest allocation nationwide. 

Initiatives proposed by the state's Department of Transportation included expanding trucker parking at rest stops to alleviate the statewide shortage that prolonged drivers' journeys and increased pollution. 

Additionally, suggestions encompassed investing in electric buses and roundabouts to curtail emissions during traffic light idling.

Despite these eco-friendly proposals, last month saw Florida's Department of Transportation, led by Secretary Jared Perdue, declining participation in the federal program, labeling the initiative as part of the ""continued politicization of our roadways."" 

His sentiments mirrored those of Governor Ron DeSantis, who has controversially dismissed climate change as the ""politicization of the weather."" 

Strikingly, Florida now stands isolated as the sole state rejecting the funding, and any mention of the state's emission-reducing plan has been expunged from its official website.

Even in contrast to Texas, known for its conservative stance, Florida remains isolated in its refusal of the allocated funds. 

Texas, while often vying for conservative credentials alongside Governor DeSantis, has confirmed its intent to accept the allocated $641 million.

It's no wonder DeSantis' presidential campaign is on life support."

THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IS USING HITLER'S TALKING POINTS.

That Republicans haven't come out in unity to condemn trump's remarks is a glaring indictment against the lack of courage and principles in that party. 

Country before party, FFS."
"🚨CLARENCE THOMAS: PAY TO STAY 

In shocking new revelations from ProPublica, it has been learned that conservative money started flowing in SCOTUS Justice Clarence Thomas' direction when he complained that he might leave the Supreme Court.

The remarkable reporting reveals that Thomas, who was earning $173,000 in 2000 (the equivalent of $300K in 2023), was not satisfied with the amount of money he was making as a SCOTUS Justice and openly griped that Congress should increase their pay.

On the plane ride home from a speech, Thomas told Florida GOP Rep. Cliff Stearns that if members of Congress didn't boost their salaries and lift a ban on paid speeches, “one or more justices will leave soon,” meaning as soon as the next 12 months.

From that moment on, Thomas was the recipient of a steady flow of very expensive gifts from wealthy conservatives like Harlan Crow, including everything from free vacations on super yachts and private jets to tuition payments for the private school his grandnephew attended.

Rep. Stearns said about Thomas' remarks, in a recent interview, “His importance as a conservative was paramount. We wanted to make sure he felt comfortable in his job and he was being paid properly.”

This should be a MUCH bigger story."

"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the election workers who were defamed by Rudy Giuliani, have just been awarded over $100 million in damages, including over $16 million each and $70 million in punitive damages.

The jury was in deliberations for a day, and found that the vicious lies spread about the 2 civil servants were damaging enough to warrant such a high amount. Until as recently as 2 days ago, Giuliani expressed no remorse; in fact, he doubled down.

“Of course I don’t regret it. I told the truth,” Giuliani told reporters. “They were engaged in changing votes. … Stay tuned.”

Rudy is in the finding out stage."

"My entire career I have been publicly put down and called stupid names. I have been caricatured as anti-vax, an Uncle Tom, a disgrace to my own black community, a Putin-Puppet, a transphobe, a homophobe, an inspiration to a New Zealand terrorist, a Zionist shill, an antisemite, a sell-out, an internalized misogynist. If you name it, I can probably produce the article in which I’ve been called it. 

My entire career I’ve been told my 15 minutes would be up soon. 

Needless to say, it’s been a long 15 minutes. Because people can see past these attempts to shut down conversation. 

I’ve kept the hunger but more importantly I have earned people’s trust. I refuse to go “establishment” despite the very real truth that pressure surmounts the higher you climb. 

I haven’t turned my back on friends along way, although I’ve gotten much clarity on the ones who were pretending to be my friends in order to manipulate my voice. 

I still do not claim to know everything, but I do know that the world needs more speech, not less. 

It really is that simple."
"I’m not sure why I’m trending again (frankly, I’m sick of it after this week) but as I am about to embark on maternity leave, there are perhaps a few things I would like to say:

After a little over a year of producing my podcast, I would like to clarify who I am, and who I am not— the former of which I thought would have been obvious by now. 

I started my career being maimed and attacked as being “anti-black” and “self-hating” for challenging the Black Lives Matter narrative and the lockstep commitment that corporations, politicians, Hollywood and media had in fostering a hysterical illusion that the no one had the right to challenge the movement because “slavery”. 

I didn’t do this by telling the other side to shut up. In fact, I hosted the other side (BLM chapter leaders, and protesters) on my various platforms. I flew out to Atlanta and stood on stage with T.I and was disrespected for my unique stance at a hip-hop conference. I was similarly disrespected on the world stage by Dave Chapelle during a stand up he delivered following the death of George Floyd. I took all of this on the chin and was willing to become a punching bag and a laughing stock to many because reputation means little to me in the pursuit of truth. 

I’m not here to make friends or be well-liked. Life is not a popularity contest. I’m here to differentiate between truth and fiction so that my kids can grow up in a more honest world. 

Black Lives Matter, both as an organization and an ideology has been fundamentally exposed and is now recognized as fraudulent. This process took years plus more than a few good men that were willing to stand up to its lies—but it no longer holds any political significance. Frankly, because it never should have. Because BLM destroyed lives—chief among them BLACK lives and black neighborhoods. 

It is stunning to me that people who applauded me as I stood up and had conversations and rightfully critiqued (and continue to critique) the flaws in my own community, do not think that I should or would muster up the same courage to ask simple questions or make basic observations about theirs. 

There is no two-tier system in my mind. Your specific race, color, or creed does not make you above reproach. If you watch my podcast regularly you know how very true this is. I love and hate all of you with equal measure. 

Some people are wondering why I had the nerve to sit down with Norman Finkelstein today on my podcast— Norman is an accomplished academic, whose parents both survived the Holocaust who has made a name for himself defending Palestine. 

Lately, everything I tweet, say or don’t say has been under a microscope so rather then let people who think they are wizards and can magically “read between lines” invent something out of their own paranoid neuroses, let me clearly spell out the reason why for everyone here now: 

Because last week I had a pro-Israel Jewish man, Ami Kozak on my podcast. And he was amazing and he was respectful and we had a great dialogue that everyone in the comment section applauded and loved. Because it is important that in the pursuit of truth we hear ALL sides so that we can learn and independently conduct our own research. 

It really is that simple. So go listen to my podcast with Ami and go listen to my podcast with Norman and make an effort to make up your own mind. 

Here is what I have learned in politics. Never, ever trust anyone who only presents to you one side. Never trust anyone who yells at you for wanting to hear both sides. Never trust people who call you stupid and put you down for admitting that you don’t know everything. These people are authoritarians, not experts or respectable journalists. 

As just one example: the experts didn’t want to debate about Covid and vaccination for a reason.  That’s because they were liars and frauds. 

I want everyone to know that a willingness to listen, research and learn is enough. It will always bring you closer to truth

"🚨NEWS: Donald Trump has chilling plans for how he plans to use the United States military force, and it tracks right along with his stated intention to be a dictator ""on day one.""

He plans to mobilize ""hundreds of thousands"" of troops to the U.S. southern border, and have them set up detention camps for detaining migrants, according to a new report from Rolling Stone.

The report reveals that Stephen Miller, the architect of his ""child separation"" policy, has likely devised this border-closing scheme that would include between 100,000 to 300,000 troops, one unnamed source has estimated. The plan would even require pulling troops from bases abroad, such as in Germany.

Trump's authoritarian tendencies would go completely unchecked in this scenario, as outlined in ""Project 2025,"" a blueprint for a 2nd Trump presidency that reveals his plan to only appoint people 100 percent loyal to him and him alone.

The only hope for preventing his use of the military in such a manner would be the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of our military by Presidents as a domestic police unit. 

This is an unprecedented moment in American history, where we have to consider scenarios to protect ourselves from a former President's dictatorial impulses."

"If I needed a pilot for my plane, and my choices were:

"Late teens and 20’s is more fitted for crystallizing an imperturbable foundation than it is about success.  Success comes later.

Paves the way to take bigger risks in your 30’s & 40’s.  Been Olympic lifting for 15 years w very few days off.  I can take 2 years off and not touch a weight & I’ll still look and be athletic asf.  You will see the silhouette of an athlete.  Been too long engrained to go away.

Same with social scene.  Spent so much time in 20’s socializing I can go run missions for a year or two without socializing at all and pop back in the scene like nothing ever happened.

"If u ever take a swing at an opportunity and feel like you have to nail it 1st try u don’t really want it.  U’ve convinced yourself u do.  When u really want something ur whole engine will calibrate for it.  U have an infinity clip.  U are careless bc you know it’s already yours"

"Your problems should be so unique to your skill sets and talents that it would be way over a therapists head to even try to tackle it

"When u know ur destined for greatness there is no breaking point

"Remember seeing a poker player get mopped for 3 million in a cash game & upon his exit he was interviewed

Girl asks him how he’s so calm.  He said if flipping out would get me the money back I’d be flipping out right now

All wisdom emanates from that comment"
"If you ever decide to take a non pre-prescribed path in life every action u take for urself will feel shameful af at first. Every act of freedom will feel awful.   The dumbest thing you can do is let this make you stop.  

Ur consciousness is split & the shame means it’s melding back together. Ur psyche has to fuse again between the shadow and the spirit.  Very few let these forces gel together cause it can take years of confusion terror and pain.

But once they’re cross-stitched back together and you no longer are at the behest of others you’re a force of nature who can’t ever go back"

"Surrendering will is such a gay attitude to life.  Soon as you decide to quit smth the subconscious is gonna refuse to let you take control.  Just like when a woman consciously decides she’s not gonna sleep with you she becomes more likely to do so.

An alcoholics only chance is building a system that outruns the cravings.  Maniacal fitness, eating foods of the gods, health freak to counterbalance the damage.    Cannot afford to withdraw from society and estrange himself from the ordinary world of family And business.  Needs a job that requires whip smarts/eye on ball/quick computive thinking.  Can’t daydrink cuz system will fray.  Needs to sew himself into position as proctor of a giant consequential meaningful life as chancellor.  Will be forced to move quickly to stave and quell boredom.  Drinking then becomes the reward not the escape.  Juggling massive life autofills the need to taper the bottle.

Men do not negotiate well with the subconscious.  You’re bartering while half devoured in the jaws of a tiger.  No leverage there.

"BREAKING: Anthony Alexander Antonio, the January 6th Capitol rioter who blamed ""Foxmania"" for his actions, pleaded guilty to felony charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding. 

The 29-year-old from Delaware, now facing a potential prison term of 33 to 51 months, was captured on security footage wielding a stolen riot shield in the midst of the Capitol chaos.

Prosecutors revealed Antonio's alarming behavior, detailing how he failed to assist an officer being dragged down stairs, showcasing his active participation in the violence. 

Prior to the riot, Antonio, adorned in a bulletproof vest and a far-right ""Three Percenter"" patch, was caught on camera shouting, ""You want war? We got war. 1776 all over again.""

Antonio gave an interview to the far-right news outlet VDARE at the Capitol, accusing the police of aggression. 

He justified his actions by expressing discontent with what he perceived as a stolen election, fueled by debunked conspiracies about voter fraud in Georgia. 

Antonio remarked, ""We lost lives in there. Two confirmed lives have been lost. Patriots, we took the Capitol and we’re not stopping. I will be back tonight. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe, but we’re not backing down.""

He will, in fact, be backing down into a prison cell."

Republicans refused to do anything about it, except suggest fewer doors, arming teachers, and having our little ones practice shooting drills instead of their multiplication tables.

And with that inaction, our kids are STILL being gunned down in schools.

"🚨🚨NEWS: Bombshell revelations emerge as a report exposes Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the lead in the Biden impeachment inquiry, engaging in dubious business tactics similar to those he accuses President Biden of. 

James Comer has his own shell company!

Co-owning six acres with a major campaign contributor, Comer transferred ownership to Farm Team Properties, a shadowy entity exploding in value, mirroring the opacity of Biden-associated companies, according to AP's Bryan Slodysko.

""The AP found that Farm Team Properties functions in a similarly opaque way as the companies used by the Bidens, masking his stake in the land that he co-owns with the donor from being revealed on his financial disclosure forms,"" reports Slodysko. 

Records label Farm Team Properties as Comer's wife's ""land management and real estate speculation"" company, leaving critical details undisclosed.

The land, purchased eight years ago with donor Darren Cleary, raised eyebrows as Cleary sold Comer a 50% stake for $128,000. The timing, just days before Comer's congressional campaign announcement, adds fuel to the controversy. 

Cleary's businesses have donated approximately $70,000 to Comer's political campaigns, underscoring the intertwined nature of their financial dealings.

This shocking revelation challenges Comer's credibility and raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. The striking resemblance to allegations against President Biden injects a new layer of complexity into the political landscape. 

As the spotlight intensifies, Comer should face scrutiny over financial dealings that echo the very accusations he hurls at the President."
"What gets me the most about Rudy Giuliani is that he brashly spread bold-faced lies about Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, who were doing their civic duties, and he severely disrupted their lives.

Now that it's time for him to put up or shut up in court, that scumbag straight up chickened out.

He deserves the most severe judicial penalties, give Ruby and Shaye their MILLIONS. 💰"

"⚠️ There's more to Starlink's $900M subsidy denial than meets the eye...

Recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) turned down Starlink’s bid for a nearly $866 million rural broadband subsidy, a part of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) program. 

The FCC's rationale? 

Starlink ""failed to demonstrate that it could deliver the promised service"" to underserved rural areas. 

While at first glance, this may seem a straightforward regulatory decision, a deeper dive suggests there could be more at play here.

The Timeline: A Curious Coincidence?

Just 14 months ago, Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter, a move that sent ripples through the digital and political landscapes. 

His vision for X as a bastion of free speech and his recent actions, including the re-admittance of controversial figures like InfoWars' Alex Jones, have been both lauded and criticized. 

But could these moves have inadvertently placed Starlink in the crosshairs of an increasingly politicized regulatory environment? Yes.

The FCC's decision, on the surface, hinges on procedural grounds. 

Starlink passed the preliminary application phase but supposedly stumbled in the more demanding long-form stage. 

Brendan Carr, an FCC commissioner, raised a valid question: Why was Starlink held to a precedent-setting standard, requiring it to demonstrate its service capabilities years ahead of schedule, a requirement not imposed on other awardees?

It's hard not to wonder if there's a connection between Musk's endeavor to champion free speech on X and the denial of Starlink's subsidy. 

In a climate where tech moguls and their platforms are under constant scrutiny for their roles in shaping public discourse, could this be a subtle signal to those who dare to challenge the status quo? 

Musk's recent decisions on X have certainly not gone unnoticed.

The implications of this subsidy denial decision extend beyond Starlink or even Musk himself. They reflect a broader trend where technological advancements and media platforms are increasingly caught in the crossfire of political agendas. 

In this high-stakes game, regulatory decisions, such as the one faced by Starlink, may carry undertones of larger battles being fought in the arena of public discourse and freedom of expression.

This incident should serve as a wake-up call. 

We have reached a point where our government is blackmailing major corporations to fall in line with its political agenda."

Is it because they've been bragging that they have a big ole 12-inch whopper of a case, but publicly they'll be exposed of having a teeny-weeny micro peen of a case? 

Is it because, behind closed doors, they can cherry pick facts to frame a false narrative, but in public everyone will see and hear the facts about Hunter Biden's ACTUAL testimony without a filter?

Is it all three?

"If they're going to hold Hunter Biden in Contempt of Congress, they better make sure they get Gym Jordan, Scott Perry, and Andy Biggs for it too."

""They have not laid a glove on President Biden. There is no evidence of committing any offense, much less an impeachable offense.

This is an impeachment inquiry where no one has been able to define what criminal or Constitutional offense they're looking for…

Mysteries are called a whodunnit because it starts with a crime and then you try to determine who committed it. 

This is more like a 'what is it,' not a whodunnit, we don't know what the crime is.

In July, a partial judgment was entered against Cardillo. In a motion filed today, 12/13/20, Bogachek seeks final summary judgment in the matter and a denial of Cardillo’s third request for reconsideration. Cardillo filed for reconsideration of the merits of the case twice before, and his motions were denied both times."

The internet rallied behind Alex and people called for his account to be reinstated on X. #elonmusk  put up a poll on X and the final results were a landslide in favor of Jones. People voted 70% Yes to 30% No for Alex’s return.(Who are those free speech haters who voted no? We can guess…)

"NEWS: The election workers who were publicly defamed and harassed by Rudy Giuliani have their share of horror stories, but being asked by a potential employer at a fast food chain if she was a ""traitor"" was more than unnerving for Shaye Moss.

Moss and Ruby Freeman are suing Giuliani for up to $43 million dollars for defamatory accusations he'd made when he alleged that they were passing around fake votes on a USB like drug dealers.

Moss had applied for a job at Chick-fil-A, and had a relatively successful interview experience until the interviewer showed her an online article with the word ""TRAITOR"" across the page and asked “Is this you? Is this true?""

Giuliani recently doubled down on his accusations, asked by a reporter if he regretted his statements he denied that, insisting he spoke the truth. 

One can only hope that Giuliani is held accountable for the disruption he caused to those women's lives."

"🚨BREAKING: House Republicans voted today to ensure that their investigations will be as shady as possible, omitting the words ""open and transparent"" from an amendment on the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.

This is despite MAGA House Speaker Mike Johnson pledging ""to undertake this process methodically and transparently.""

GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota is clearly opposed to moving forward on impeachment without receipts. 

“We have had enough political impeachments in this country,"" Johnson said. ""I don't like the stonewalling the administration has done, but, listen, if we don't have the receipts, then that should constrain what the House does.”

Ranking member Jim McGovern (D-MA) was outraged by the process in which Republicans seem determined to operate in the shadows. ""All we're asking for is the gentleman to put back in the words 'open and transparent.'"" McGovern said. 

""For some reason Republicans deliberately removed it. None of us can figure out why."""

"🚨BREAKING: MAGA House Speaker Mike Johnson makes the case for why it is a terrible idea to try to impeach President Joe Biden:

""If you don’t like the president, he goes on a ballot again after four years. We have an election in 11 months. Let the people decide this.”

Oops... Mike Johnson was actually talking about Donald Trump in 2019.

It bears mentioning that President Biden has not attempted to extort any of our allies, nor has he attempted to incite insurrection, which are the two issues for which Trump was impeached.

In fact, many Republicans have already admitted, in private and in public, that there is no evidence of wrongdoing to warrant an impeachment of the President."

"It's hilarious to that people still believe that trump is a good businessman:

- He had to declare bankruptcy SIX times, including for a casino. A CASINO!!!!

- He paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 so that nobody would know he had sex with her. NOW WE ALL KNOW.

- He paid an ""expert"" witness $877,000 to testify in the civil fraud trial where he is accused of overvaluing his assets. The guy testified ""The value of Donald trump's triplex was inflated.""

- He inherited a thriving, humming economy from President Obama and left it with 3 million FEWER jobs than it had at his inauguration, the absolute WORST jobs President in American history.

Don't take it for granted that you don't have to vote because you live in a blue state, so of course he won't win.

Nikki is just not equipped mentally to deal with what Trump & his family dealt with day in and day out. She’s weak."
"Women are more emotional than men. Nikki became shrill and hysterical last night. Vivek worked her up and she couldn’t regain control."
"GOP debate recap:

Not only was Vivek the unanimous winner.  A star was born today.  He shined.  He was loose.  He was comfortable yet intense.  He even gave credit to Desantis and Tim Scott multiple times.  A good balance between a fighter, leader and a synergist.  He kept going to Desantis on each break and spark a conversation with him.  Another Sign of a synergist.  

He kept giving different perspectives.  Changing definition of overdose to terrorist poisoning. 

He was so captivating tonight that if you watch the replay, you’d notice even his opponents impressed with his answers.  

Desantis was the most poised I’ve ever seen.  He’s super comfortable.  And was Presidential.  Best I’ve seen him.  He was even funny and loose.  

Nikki Haley was favored to win but she seemed rattled and upset. It’s as if she came with an agenda and Vivek disrupted her.  She is by far the best in giving data. But she was a bit off today.  

Christie didn’t call out Vivek or anyone else like he did in first two debates.  Which means he knows this could be his last GOP debate.  

Tim Scott got a ton of speaking time but I found myself thinking I’m at Church instead of at a debate.  Seems like a nice man but way Too bland.  

Having said that, this was the best of the 3 debates.  

Great job to moderators.  

The voters won today."

The rattling irony is you’re 100x more likely to get everything you wanted in that period where you let it go while ur chasing the big cake than ever before.  You’ll lose weight, you’ll lose muscle, you’ll lose some of your looks guaranteed.  And you’re far more attractive to the world in this state.  Soon as the vanity goes, your stride looks different.

"ADHD is gods gift to man.  You’re a bull in a China shop-the mundane leaves you hassled in soul-sucking disgust

But you can crack the fuck out of any code with just a mild application of focus.  All knowledge gets plunged by mother fuckers with adhd"
"Signs of major ADHD

Picking up dirty clothes to throw in hamper feels like deadlifting 600lbs
Paperwork impossible to fill out
Slamming shoulder on door jams when walking thru 3x a day 
Losing phone in couch 3x a day but insane ability to remember obscure facts"
"Easiest gimme low hanging fruit mental edge u can get right now is training hard in sweltering heat

Americans steadily inclining toward terror of the sun

Run up mountain carrying something heavy in the inferno & ur mentally stronger than 99% ez"
"Be the best version of urself is gay advice in ur 20’s.  Gotta be the worst version 1st.  Test your boundaries. How hard can you go all in on work. How hard can you fall.  How much can you give to 1 person.

Best version of u manifests after doing everything that’s not you"
"90% of good health is simply living in ancient accord with what the blood drum in your heart wants you to do

Very easily explains why mf’ers who chainsmoke, drink like fish & live decadent and debaucherously  cheat not only death but aging as well"

"Cuz It’s also the only challenge that’s agnostic of ur starting point. Be it born rich, poor, ugly, handsome, popular, loner 

Nothing maximizes ur chances of finding the right mate except ur genetic disposition.  Total dice roll"
"Finding a good wife is easily the most important accomplishment in man’s life 

Becoming a titan of industry is a cake-walk in comparison.  Much more scriptable path.  Just be a loner/hoodie type & work hard

No scriptable path for being a man deserving of love tho"
"Nietzsche was too strong. Why he died a loser. He was too willing to cut ties off for the sake of truth. To withdraw to solitude. He didn’t know how to dance to life. How to accept the pitfalls of society. To accept his own shortcomings"

"Do I need to do a spaces to
Cover gut health for yA’ll?"
"Gut biome is the fulcrum from which a man’s personality is constructed.    Men are literally driven by the parasites and bacteria in their stomach.  Modern enviro has most men’s stomachs in wretches

Give ur dog antibiotics for a week (nukes GI)  and watch its personality change"
"My most metaphysical belief is if you’re a do nothing bitch of a man, a numale, the forces of nature work to destroy you

A guy living in accord with his nature gets morning sun and radiates all day long

A guy living in discord gets morning sun and gets left w a burn & a squint"

"As promised—More information about Audrey Hale, the #NashvilleShooter

Watch now: piped.video/jQ6vU3gvrrY?si=K945…"
"Correct."
"BREAKING: I just got word that two officers are due to be fired over the the release of the #NashvilleManifesto pages. 
Allegedly, the documents were sold by one of the officers.

Yesterday I said that I wanted to wait to report on the released pages because while it was a major break, I felt the documents were incomplete and did not paint an accurate picture of what transpired given the amount of evidence we know was collected in the aftermath of the horrific shooting. 

I am glad I waited. Yesterday evening I was contacted by a source with more concrete information regarding all of details on #AudreyHale ‘s many notebooks and what her true motive was. I will be breaking this on my podcast today. 

Credit where it’s due— this only happened because the Crowder team reopened this conversation in a major way by releasing the initial 3 pages of Audrey’s journal. 
This was great work which will lead to major answers for parents like myself who live in the #Covenant community and have been infuriated by the lack of information presented to the public. 

Stay tuned."

"‼️📄 Hours after the shooting, Metro Nashville Police executed a search warrant on Audrey Hales home.

They found 20 journals, 6 school yearbooks, writings, hard drives and a suicide note alongside a cache of weaponry which included ammunition, firearms, accessories, and shooting targets.

Inventory of seized property:"
"As a mother I disagree. As an advocate against the mental illness that is transgenderism, I disagree. 
We have to look evil in the face if we want to defeat it. I want to know everything there is to know about a trans person that ruthlessly murders Christian schoolchildren—up to and including the pharmaceutical drugs she was on. 
Every page of every notebook. Every text message. Everything."
"Holding my comments regarding the  #NashvilleManifesto because I am unsure if it is in fact the manifesto, or just 3 pages from the shooter’s notebook. 

My earlier understanding was the that the shooter had a detailed manifesto which spelled out the reasons for the attack which was being withheld? 

Either way I hope this at the very least puts pressure on the authorities to release everything they have because the public has always had a right to know."
"After 9/11, George Bush and Dick Cheney sent America’s sons and daughters - people my age - to die in the Middle East and racked up $7TN in debt for pointless wars that hurt this country. No-win wars that cost trillions, killed millions & made corrupt politicians billions. They passed the Patriot Act, violated the Constitution & weaponized the justice system. 20 years later later, the Taliban is still in charge in Afghanistan. 20 years later, it’s a hostile anti-American regime running Iraq. And now 20 years later, it’s Dick Cheney 2.0 trying to reclaim the GOP again. That’s the real choice we face in this primary: do you want to rack up trillions more in debt & send our sons and daughters to die fighting someone else’s war in places like Ukraine and the Middle East?

As a father, my obligation is to my family - period. And as the next President, my sole obligation will be to the American people - period. Now is our moment for choosing. We can choose the past. Or we can choose the future."

"🚨🚨2024 ELECTION ALERT:

""If you can't beat 'em, cheat 'em"" should be Republicans' new motto as explosive revelations point to a sinister plot by Donald Trump's allies to manipulate the 2024 election. 

According to a damning report, nine GOP-led states have abandoned the bipartisan Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), leaving the door wide open for potential election interference. 

The move comes after Trump loyalists, fueled by conspiracy theories, attacked ERIC, with prominent election denier Cleta Mitchell at the forefront of convincing states to embrace the dubious EagleAI software, a risky alternative, says Rolling Stone.

David Becker, ERIC's former executive director, warns of dire consequences, stating, “Their voter lists are likely to be significantly less accurate.” The shift increases the likelihood of outdated records and false claims of voter fraud, creating chaos at the polls. 

It's essentially a MAGA mass voter fraud machine.

Becker emphasizes the correlation between faulty voter lists and increased potential for violence, as losers exploit delays and obstacles to falsely cry foul play.

Founded in 2012 by Pew Charitable Trusts, ERIC aimed to modernize voter-registration data and eliminate inaccuracies. However, EagleAI, drawing from public data like obituaries and property tax records, enables mass challenges to voters. 

Georgia's Columbia County, a Republican stronghold, has already embraced EagleAI, raising concerns about potential unlawful list-maintenance activities, as voiced by the state's director of elections, Blake Evans.

The crooked machinations surrounding the abandonment of ERIC and the adoption of EagleAI cast a shadow over the integrity of future elections. As Trump's allies exploit loopholes in the electoral system, the risk of chaos, violence, and false claims of stolen elections looms large.

This needs to be a MUCH bigger story."

"🚨🚨BREAKING: A former police chief, anti-vaxxer, and yoga teacher has been sentenced to over a decade in prison for the role he played in the January 6th attack at the US Capitol.

56-year-old California resident Alan Hostetter was convicted in July, and was representing himself in the sentencing hearing before he was sentenced by Judge Royce C. Lamberth to 135 months in prison. He must report to prison by January 5, 2024.

Hostetter reportedly opted not to fly to Washington DC, in order to be able to ""load his car with weapons."" He loaded multiple hatchets into his car as well as a stun gun and pepper spray.

Prosecutors for the DOJ also noted statements he'd made prior to January 6th such as “Choke that city off. Fill it with patriots” and “Put the fear of God into Members of Congress.”  

Ironically, despite his own admitted and heavily-documented involvement in January 6th, he somehow still believes that January 6th was a ""false flag"" operation.

He is another dangerous criminal off the streets who should have stayed home and practiced yoga instead."

"BREAKING: Donald Trump's defense in the $250 million fraud trial just suffered a DEVASTATING blow from his own witness, who said that there was ""no question"" that he inflated the value of his property.

Eli Bartov, an accounting professional, testified that records show the disgraced former President boosted the value of his Trump Tower triplex by $100 million between 2011 and 2012.

“The price was inflated. There is no question about it,” Bartov said.

And then he attempted to claim that the error had more to do with inept blundering on the balance sheet instead of intentional fraud, asserting that Trump would have worked harder to hide fraud if he'd committed it.

It should be noted that Trump, who routinely tells easily disprovable lies, neither works hard nor is he capable of or interested in hiding his crimes, which is why he now faces 91 felony counts.

The hearing then turned fiery as the Attorney General's counsel objected to Bartov's testimony, saying that his comments exceed his area of expertise and that Bartov was ""hired to say whatever it is they want.”

Bartov reportedly EXPLODED in response, saying “You make up allegations that never existed... You should be ashamed of yourself, talking to me like that.""

"Every few months, Mitt Romney will stand up, take a deep breath, and utter some kind of attempt at defiance in the shadow of trump, pretending to have rediscovered his spine.

But Mittens will forever be who he was in this picture: neutered, feckless, impotent, and unable to fully rebuke the guy who transformed his political party into a drunken, back alley knife fight.

Maybe Romney is just incredibly out of touch, since all of the millions he and his family has will isolate them from any real harm if trump wrecks the place.

Romney offered his opinion on trump's statement that he'd be a dictator ""on day one"" by minimizing its importance: “Sometimes a little baby will spout off all sorts of words that you don’t take either literally or seriously.""

That ""little baby"" orchestrated a coup, Mitt.
He tried to bury democracy in a shallow grave on January 6th, ffs.

Wasn't Mitt in the building when people were smearing feces on the walls, when they were busting windows and doors, and clobbering Capitol Police with fire extinguishers???

He's actually decided to leave the Senate because there's nothing left of what used to be his party. MANY Republican politicians who are unwilling to MAGA-ize themselves are doing the same.

I get mad at Romney, that guy who tried (and lost) his bid to beat President Obama, because every now and then he'll say something that sounds responsible, makes sense, and makes me forget he's the guy who tied his dog to the roof of his car.

The guy with an elevator for his cars.

The guy eating a plateful of crow in this picture with trump, right after swallowing his pride to beg for a position.

That's who Mitt Romney is. He's not built for taking down wannabe dictators.

That's why we have a Biden-led Democratic party. We'll finish the damn job. 💙🇺🇸"

4. He handily beat the GOP frontrunner.

Donald is using tens of millions of dollars of donor money to pay not only his lawyers, but the LAWYERS OF POTENTIAL WITNESSES AND CO-DEFENDANTS.

The Save America PAC has paid nearly $37 million to over 60 law firms and attorneys since 2022.

But Why would Donald pay for witnesses’ legal fees?

Typically the DOJ charges the underlings in the hopes they turn on the big fish. But here's the question. If the PAC is paying for their legal bills, does that make them less likely to turn on Donald?

There's more! PACs are NOT PERMITTED to use donor funds to benefit campaigns. How does keeping Donald out of jail not benefit his campaign? 🤔

I have some thoughts bout how to make this illegal. It starts with raising hell with the FEC. Are you in? 👇

"Thanks for asking @jamie_raskin, the answer is simple: President Trump was the best friend Jewish people have had in the White House in modern times.

1. The Trump Administration recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. The move was a significant step in acknowledging Jerusalem as the Jewish people's historical and spiritual capital.

2. The Trump Administration brokered the historic Abraham Accords. These peace agreements have led to increased cooperation between Israel and Arab nations.

3. President Trump officially recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

4. President Trump withdrew us from the catastrophic Iran Nuclear Deal.

5. The Trump Administration signed an executive order in 2019 that extended Title VI protections against discrimination to Jewish students on college campuses which is more important than ever today.

"Living from the heart is the essence of masculinity. Comes with its own preset conditions. Can’t be punctured or influenced.  The head is female.  Needs input to parse.  Women live in their heads men live in their hearts. Sit n think about it. Royally true"
"The person you want to become is going to cost you people, spaces, relationships, and material things.

Gotta choose the person you’re becoming every time"

The $$ talk on here is so dull and boring.  Everyone runs a fucking business.  Work and $ is the baseline

"90% of the dread in the service industry comes from being forced to serve unimportant people.  The second a *perceived* to be important person needs help, even the laziest most existentially tortured employee will spring to life to serve them

Lesson in there"
"What no one hyped up on success porn will tell you is that almost all high achievers dread what they do.  The best of the best despise their craft but hate & love are very close.  They’re compelled to do it anyway.  COMPELLED.

"The Israeli children are in fact missing and it’s abhorrent to tear down posters of them. There is no cap on posters so if you’d like to post the New York children that are missing or any other missing children worldwide you should do it. 
You have a right to advocate for causes you care about everywhere. I wouldn’t tear down a poster of a missing Haitian child because “this is not Haiti”. 
Missing children anywhere is sad. 
I don’t get why this is hard for some people to understand."
"I always defend speech, even the kind I disagree with. 

I do not think America should send money overseas to fight foreign wars and I never accept the lies from politician that we do so in an effort to “spread democracy”. 

Activists pulling down signs of missing/dead Israeli children is positively abhorrent and evil. I cannot comprehend it. 

Activists glossing over dead Palestinian children as if their lives mean less is similarly abhorrent and evil—I cannot comprehend it. 

Genocide, no matter which government expresses its aim, is always indefensible. 

Protect civilians. Fight terrorism. 

These are my views."
"And to those of you who will inevitably attempt to further smear me, threaten me or in utmost hysteria—attempt to destroy what you perceive to be my livelihood because I will not acquiesce to your radicalism— let me remind you: you cannot destroy what you did not create. 

I lived through more before the age of 7 than most of you will likely ever endure in your lifetime. 

Your mean tweets make me laugh."
"I agree with Queen Rania’s assertion that antisemitism is being weaponized in order to silence critics and bully people into compliance.
That Charlie Kirk, Elon Musk, and Thomas Massie have recently been smeared as antisemites is proof of this charge. 
This is the same behavior we saw from Black Lives Matter activists when the threat of being labeled a racist or a white supremacist was being used to shut down legitimate questions about the funding and intentions of the organization, which in time proved to be fraudulent. 

I have never been a person that is fearful to state the truth and to call out the people and organizations that are engaging in silencing tactics—even when the cost of doing so meant I was caricatured by my own community as a “race traitor.”

We have a right to hear any and every political debate, free from the threat of smears. 

My position on this has not and will not shift, ever. 

More speech. Not less."

"30,000 children of illegal migrants entered schools in NYC in September. And the numbers are only growing. The cost to the taxpayer of education at public schools in NYC is $30,000 per child. So that’s almost $1 billion just there. For one year. Not accounting for language and special needs.
Eric Adams probably won’t be speaking so bluntly after the DOJ scared him this week as he was on his way to DC to ask Biden to help. 
But this is what he said when the schools were being overwhelmed a few weeks ago: “Never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to. I don’t see an ending to this. Now we’re getting people from all over the globe [who] have made their minds up that they’re going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City.” npr.org/2023/09/18/119909978…."

"HISTORICALLY UNFIT: It was revealed by former Trump White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah Griffin that Trump once demanded a staffer be ""executed"" for leaking extremely embarrassing info about him.

Griffin, who noted on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump is ""historically unfit,"" has not been timid in her criticism of her former boss. She added that he is the only former President to be denounced by his former Chief of Staff, Defense Secretary, National Security Advisor, and more.

During a recent airing of ""The View,"" Griffin revealed that Trump learned that a staffer leaked a story about his retreating to a bunker during the George Floyd protests and, in an Oval Office meeting with 12 other staffers, he said that person should be executed.

""He's used that terminology with Gen. [Mark] Milley. I cannot set off enough alarm bells about how dangerous he is and that he must be stopped at all costs,"" Griffin warned.

The White House would later release a statement that Trump wasn't hiding in the bunker, just inspecting it."

"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: After nine months in a pointless blockade preventing military promotions from advancing, Senator Tommy Tuberville has finally backed down, lifting his embargo.

The Alabama Senator was jeopardizing America's military readiness in an ill-advised political stunt, objecting to a Pentagon policy allowing service members to travel for abortion care.

The caveat on his relinquinshed hold is that he will continue to block promotions for Four Star Generals, because the selfish Senator can't possibly be expected to give up the entire spotlight.

Meanwhile, thou9gh, almost 400 service members will finally be able to move forward with logistical plans related to their new positions and responsibilities while keeping America safe.

"Thin-skinned Trump lashes back at DeNiro:

Former President Donald Trump unleashed a furious response to actor Robert De Niro's recent criticism at the Gotham Awards ceremony. 

De Niro, angered by the omission of his own prepared anti-Trump comments from the teleprompter during his speech, defiantly read them from his phone, highlighting Trump's alleged thousands of lies.

On Trump's Truth Social platform, the Republican 2024 front-runner retaliated, dubbing De Niro a ""total loser."" Trump questioned De Niro's acting prowess, claiming it had greatly diminished, and ridiculed him for using a teleprompter for his ""foul and disgusting language."" 

Trump's Truth Social post reads:

""Robert De Niro, whose acting talents have greatly diminished, with his reputation now shot, must even use a teleprompter for his foul and disgusting language, so disrespectful to our Country. He has become unwatchable both in movies, and with the FOOLS that destroyed the Academy Awards, bringing them from one of the top shows in the Country to a Low Rated afterthought. De Niro should focus on his life, which is a mess, rather than the lives of others. He has become a total loser, as the World watches, waits, and laughs!""

As of now, De Niro has not responded to Trump's latest comments. However, during the awards ceremony, De Niro had mercilessly criticized Trump, particularly highlighting the alleged 30,000 lies and referring to him as a ""charlatan."" 

It should also be noted that Trump himself uses a teleprompter all the time, and frequently reads it poorly.

He has also failed to win an Emmy, while President Obama was awarded one, and Robert DeNiro has two Oscar Awards."

Greene posted on X: ""Maxine Waters is attacking me for taking a PPP loan (like so many had to), before I was a member of congress, when the tyrannical government shut us all down.  

Maxine is 85 yrs old and has held government office since 1976!!!  

She has no idea what it’s like to meet payroll and keep a business running.""

But the real issue here is that Greene had her $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven, while hypocritically voting AGAINST student loan forgiveness.

In fact, her criticism of student loan forgiveness sounded exactly like this: “For our government just to say, you know, ‘Ok, well your debt is completely forgiven,’ … it’s completely unfair,” Greene said in her best ""forgiveness-for-me, not-for-thee"" tone.

Greene isn't the only millionaire to have her PPP loans forgiven, but she is the loudest and one of the most hypocritical when it comes to those less fortunate getting an assist from the government."

"Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone who saw Governor Newsom manhandle Ron DeSantis last night, and looks forward to him joining the deep Democratic bench in the race for President.

IN 2028.💪🇺🇸"
"Clear winner of last night's debate between Ron DeSantis and Governor Gavin Newsom:

President Joseph R. Biden! 🇺🇸💙"
"A few things most Republicans don't  know about Hunter Biden, that he:

- is a Yale educated lawyer
- is a successful entrepreneur/venture capitalist
- was appointed 5 yr on Amtrak Board - as VP - by President George W. Bush in 2006
- is a Humanitarian: most people are unaware that:  

Hunter Biden was Chairman of the Board of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., from 2011 to 2015.  

Which supports the work of the UN World Food Programme, which has HUGE impact.

While Chairman, Hunter Biden helped increase funding 60 percent in five years - to more than $2 billion.

$2 billion.

That's a lot of starving people fed!

And just for fun, let's see how many horrible comments are made by people who clearly didn't read this. There's always a few.

Kinda wish they would read it though. Hunter Biden is an inspiring person. This is only a few small things."
"This debate was painful to watch, with all of Pudding Fingers' yelling over Newsom. In some ways, DeSantis is even worse than trump, because he's ""smarter"" than trump, but somehow LESS human."
"If you agree that Gavin Newsom totally thrashed Ron DeSantis in this debate, I suggest you follow us at @ReallyAmerican1 where we know that DeSantis' fascist tendencies would be a nightmare for America."
"Governor Gavin Newsom:

Biden will be reelected.
trump will be rejected.

AMEN. 🙏"
"What part of ""abortion should be up to the mother and her doctor"" do you not understand, Hannity?

Ron DeSantis banned abortion at six weeks, before they even know they're pregnant.

It's NOBODY'S business except the mother and her doctor."
"Ron DeSantis is getting pummeled so badly he's resorted to screaming on top of Governor Newsom's voice.

Pathetic behavior for a robot."
"Governor Newsom is beating Ron DeSantis about the head with Bidenomics, and all Boots McPuddin' can do is smile awkwardly."
"Y'all wanna see a body? 

Governor Newsom: ""There's one thing we have in common, neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024.""

💀💀💀"
"Anyone else have a feeling that Gavin Newsom will DESTROY DeSantis in their debate tonight? 🤚"
"This is INCREDIBLE:

Rep. Stacey Plaskett BRILLIANTLY schools Jim Jordan about the hypocrisy of chairing a weaponization committee, but not being interested in Trump's open threats to weaponize the government."
"What do you notice about this picture of Lauren Boebert, Anna Paulina Luna, and Dave Chappelle?"
"I believe in free speech.
I also believe in consequences.

I remember as a kid, I'd see one guy tell another guy his mother was a prostitute, and then I'd watch that dude get his ass kicked in.

There was no law preventing that guy from disrespecting the other one's mom, but he found out about consequences.

I remember walking through certain department stores when I was older, I'd become aware that for absolutely no reason, I was being followed by store employees -- even though I was dressed in my work clothes, at the time a suit and tie.

That was the sort of thing you became accustomed to, being treated with glaring suspicion, some places were less obvious about it than others.

But I decided I didn't like being treated like that, so I stopped spending my money there.

That store was free to treat me the way they wanted to, and I was free to take my business elsewhere.

Consequences.

Imagine you've been going to a certain restaurant for years, bringing family and friends, and then suddenly there's new management.

The new management decides that they want to allow Nazis to dine there, and then allow those Nazis to be disruptive and make other customers feel unsafe with their behavior.

If you and other customers decide to leave, because they feel unsafe, would you blame the customers?

You can't blame the customers for that.
Change your behavior, or lose business.

Consequences.

If you're telling a business owner that they're doing something you don't like, and their answer is to go f*ck yourself if you don't like it, then the customer isn't killing the business, the owner is.

Free speech allows the owner to say that.
Free market allows the consequences of the customer deciding to take their business elsewhere.

Even a ""genius"" billionaire should know."
"It's bizarre to me that Matt Gaetz believes that ""if George Santos is convicted, then he ought to be expelled,"" but if trump is convicted, he's all-in for him to occupy the highest office in America.

Make that make sense."
"George Santos is such a slimy, sleazy member of Congress, it would serve Republicans right if they are unable to expel him from Congress.

Maybe let him be the albatross around Republicans' necks for all of 2024.

""GOP: We're pro-corruption!"" or something."

Thank you Briana for your bravery in this most difficult and personal conversation.

"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. 

There is no justification for a genocide. 

I can’t believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state."
"In short— If the blanket statement that genocide is wrong upsets you in any way, then you need to check yourself. 

I said exactly what I meant and I won’t be backing down or apologizing or further clarifying this statement."
"What’s amazing about this is that I did not name any country in this tweet. I simply stated that genocide is wrong— ALWAYS. This is not a controversial stance. 

Interesting how you interpreted it."
"Meet Briana. 
Briana is just 22 years old, and chose to have bottom surgery years earlier after Jazz Jennings’ show and tik tok surgeons covinced him he’d be happier living as a woman. 
This is the most devastating interview I have ever given in my career and it is my hope that no matter where you stand on this issue, you take the time to watch this gut-wrenching interview which will drop tomorrow on my YouTube channel.

"MASSIVE STORY 

A judge has just overturned a mayoral primary election in Bridgeport, CT after Democrat operatives were CAUGHT BALLOT STUFFING.

This video was leaked and reveals a Democrat clerk stuffing this drop box multiple times with illegal ballots in the same day. Judge Clark wrote in his ruling:

“The volume of ballots so mishandled is such that it calls the result of the primary election into serious doubt and leaves the court unable to determine the legitimate result of the primary.”

How common is this?
Will this case be the first of many?
Does this create legal precedent for future ballot stuffing cases?"
"No I did not hear it, but I don’t doubt it exists or that it was indeed horrific— I have seen despicable, inhumane things on the internet from either sides of this conflict. But the shameful conduct of some should never be used to justify the dehumanization of an entire group. 
To suggest that there are no innocent civilians (Israeli, Palestinian or otherwise) is genocidal rhetoric. It signals that it would be fine to kill every infant and child of a particular race because they are nothing but eventual terrorists. 

It is maniacal and wrong. There are always innocent civilians in every war. 

Brian Mast is not some college campus kid or a teenager on tik-tok. He is a sitting U.S congressman and his words carry weight."
"Yeah this was disgusting. Utterly dehumanizing. 
Of course there are innocent civilians on either side of every conflict and we should not forget that. 

This is shameful, inhumane rhetoric."
"Legends. 😂🇺🇸"
"Never trust politicians who say 

they can reduce inflation by spending your money

they can prevent extreme weather events by limiting what you eat

"I have many gay fans. They just want nothing to do with the clinical insanity that is transgenderism.

"BREAKING NEWS: Second Circuit Court of Appeals grants bond pending appeal in the Douglass Mackey meme case

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals just overruled the District Court in granting our motion for bond pending appeal. This ruling is huge because it means that the appeals court decided that my appeal presents ""substantial"" and ""debatable"" issues of law that, if resolved in my favor, will result in my conviction being vacated. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that my appeal was frivolous and that this was a typical election crime case like any other in U.S. history. This is a very encouraging step towards vindication.

Here is the full text of the court order:

Case Name: United States of America v. Mackey

Case Number: 23-7577

Docket Text:

MOTION ORDER, granting motion for release pending appeal, at docket entry 16 Mackey’s surrender date is stayed. The District Court is ordered to determine the appropriate terms of release, without prejudice to the government’s making a future request for detention, on behalf of Appellant Douglass Mackey, It is further ordered that this appeal is expedited. Mackey’s initial brief will be due on or before January 5, 2024. The government’s response will be due on or before February 5, 2024. Mackey’s reply brief will be due on or before February 20, 2024. The Clerk is directed to calendar this appeal as soon as practicable after February 20, 2024, GEL, MHP, OAW*, *Judge Omar A. Williams, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation, FILED. [Entered: 12/04/2023 02:41 PM]

If we lose the appeal in the Second Circuit, we will swiftly file an appeal with the Supreme Court.

I want to extend my gratitude and thanks to all benefactors, supporters, and all of the great attorneys who have worked on my case.

It is not cheap, however, to appeal a case in the federal court system, so I am asking you to please help us fund this case in any way you can. Prayers are also welcome and appreciated, and I will, of course, keep all benefactors and supporters in my prayers.

If you wish to support my cause financially, you may donate via the Meme Defense Fund (memedefensefund.com), a third-party nonprofit that has generously lent its support to this case. You also have the option of donating via GiveSendGo (givesendgo.com/douglassmacke…). Or, you can send Bitcoin or other crypto, cash, or a check in the mail.

"🚨NEWS: Trump attorney Alina Habba is accused of tricking a Trump employee into signing a non disclosure agreement after alleged sexual harassment claims.

A former Trump National Golf Club employee, Alice Bianco, has filed a lawsuit in a New Jersey court, accusing club manager Pavel Melichar of sexual harassment and coercion into sex in 2021. 

Bianco alleges retaliation in the workplace and an attempt to silence her through an illegal non-disclosure agreement (NDA) orchestrated by attorney Alina Habba.

Following harassment, an anonymous co-worker informed Donald Trump's staff, prompting a human resources call to Bianco. 

Opting for legal representation, she claims that Habba, a club member and not yet a Trump lawyer, posed as a friend, forwarding a negative article about her lawyer, attempting to influence her to dismiss him.

Habba allegedly met Bianco during a shift, dissuading her from going public and promising protection in exchange for signing an NDA. The agreement included a hefty penalty for violation, coupled with a purportedly paltry sum. 

Bianco's attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, asserted that Habba's actions were predatory, saying in a statement ""Pretending to be ‘neutral’ when acting on behalf of one party is clearly unethical.""

These unethical allegations against Habba are unsurprising, despite her vehement denials, and consistent with the kind of people Trump consistently employs, certainly not ""the best people."""

"The fact that @MSNBC canceled Mehdi Hasan's show while the absolutely horrible Andrea Mitchell is still employed there is proof that they are not listening to their audience.

You may disagree with some of Medhi Hasan's positions, but you cannot disagree that he always came prepared for an interview.

He was actually doing the thing that we believe journalists are supposed to be able to do: ask questions, and push through the bullshit when the person tries to avoid answering truthfully.

Hasan is a hard-hitting journalist who consistently maintained a professional demeanor while insisting his guests answer his damn questions, no matter how uncomfortable they were.

While MSNBC still retains some journalists whose work I still trust and admire, this decision stinks of politics, and I'm disgusted by it. 

Sorry to see him go."
"Lawrence O'Donnell just recapped how easily trump got away with the lie that he had people in Hawaii looking into President Obama’s birth certificate:

""he quickly learned how weak tv news could be in real-time fact checking, and he relies on that weakness to this day.""

I remember screaming at the TV, asking ""where is the pushback, he's told these lies before, why aren't you prepared for this??"" whenever he repeated easily disproven lies.

It was infuriating, they treated him like he was an oddity, like a side show instead of a dangerous carnival barker selling poison, and they never treated him like the threat he was. 

We don't have trump derangement syndrome. We just don't want that lying fucker pissing on us and saying that it's raining. We don't want him destroying our democracy.

He once said if he lost to Joe Biden, he'd leave the country, and his stupid criminal ass is still here, running for President to try to stay out of prison.

He should have just fucked off and painted, or played golf, or whatever it is that former Presidents do to stay the fuck out of our faces.

Instead, he's facing 91 felony counts, and I will party my ass off when he's finally convicted. 

Until then, we're going to call out the news media when they go soft on trump, because they already failed us once before.

And we're going to call out whatever bullshit Orange Jesus is selling.

Believe me."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: In another disgusting and predictable trump attack today, Donald Trump took aim at Judge Arthur Engoron's family shortly after an appeals court reinstated a gag order against him.

A New York appellate court implemented an unexplained gag order, restricting Trump from targeting court staff. Notably, this order excludes the judge and his family. 

Trump had previously directed attacks at the judge's wife, alleging she posted derogatory comments about him on social media.

Undeterred by the limited order, the former president reiterated his accusations on Truth Social, stating, ""This is the Judge's Wife and Family that are putting these things out."" 

Trump questioned the fairness of the trial, emphasizing, ""Can this be happening in America? This is the most unfair Trial in the History of New York, and I've had some pretty unfair Trials!""

Accompanying his statement, Trump shared a tweet he attributed to the judge's wife, featuring images of him in an orange prison jumpsuit. The broader scope of the term ""family"" in Trump's reference remains unclear.

Despite Trump's claims, Dawn Engoron has vehemently denied any association with a Twitter or X account, raising questions about the source and authenticity of the alleged disparaging remarks.

Of course, most allegations coming from Trump have proven to be blatant lies that news media struggles to keep up with because he sprays the news cycle with so much falsehood. 

His dangerous attacks continue unabated, despite fines and gag orders. Judges will need to consider harsher penalties and consequences for Trump."
"BREAKING: trump's gag order preventing him from attacking Judge Engoron's clerk in his fraud trial has just been reinstated by a NY Appeals court.

"🚨🚨LORDY, THERE ARE TAPES: Recently-revealed audio receipts DESTROY Trump's attempted fraud defense.

In a bombshell revelation during his civil fraud trial, Donald Trump attempted to shift blame for inflating his Trump Tower penthouse's value. 

However, a jaw-dropping audio recording from 2015 obtained by Forbes exposes Trump reciting the exaggerated square footage figures during an interview, contradicting his trial claims.

Trump boasted, ""This wraps all around the building. And I have three times three. So there’s like 11,000 feet on a floor. So I have three. So 33,000—and I have the roof."" 

Yet, the actual square footage was just under 11,000. This revelation undermines Trump's attempt to distance himself and pin the blame on others within the Trump Organization.

Forbes, which uncovered the square-footage discrepancy in 2017, notes that Trump falsely claimed at the trial to have personally spotted the error and directed corrections. 

The timeline reveals the truth—Forbes informed Trump's team in February 2017, but the incorrect figures persisted until after Forbes exposed the deception with an article titled 'Donald Trump Has Been Lying About The Size Of His Penthouse' in May 2017.

This audio bombshell not only exposes Trump's false claims but raises questions about his credibility in the ongoing trial as the revelation suggests a calculated effort to inflate his assets."

After wailing and moaning for ten months about Hunter Biden and alluding to some vast unproven family conspiracy, after sending Hunter Biden a subpoena to appear and testify, Chairman Comer and the Oversight Republicans now reject his offer to appear before the full Committee and the eyes of the world to answer any questions that they pose?

What an epic humiliation for our colleagues and what a frank confession that they are simply not interested in the facts and have no confidence in their own case or the ability of their own Members to pursue it.

After the miserable failure of their impeachment hearing in September, Chairman Comer has now apparently decided to avoid all Committee hearings where the public can actually see for itself the logical, rhetorical and factual contortions they have tied themselves up in.

The evidence has shown time and again President Biden has committed no wrongdoing, much less an impeachable offense.

Chairman Comer's insistence that Hunter Biden's interview should happen behind closed doors proves it once again. 

What the Republicans fear most is sunlight and the truth.""

Upon learning that Apple, the backers of the film, allowed his remarks to be removed, DeNiro bristled at the notion of thanking them. 

""I don't feel like thanking them at all for what they did. How dare they do that, actually,"" DeNiro said.

DeNiro had been discussing his latest project with director Martin Scorsese, ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" when he discovered that his own remarks critical of Trump were removed from the teleprompter.

So he read them from his phone.

""History isn't history anymore. Truth is not truth. Even facts are being replaced by alternative facts and driven by conspiracy theories and ugliness. In Florida, young students are taught that slaves developed skills which can be applied for their personal benefit.""

""Lying has become just another tool in the charlatan's arsenal. The former president lied to us more than 30,000 times during his four years in office, and he's keeping up the pace in his current campaign of retribution. 

But with all his lies, he can't hide his soul. He attacks the weak, destroys the gifts of nature, and shows disrespect — for example, by using 'Pocahontas' as a slur.""

He levied accusations of extramarital affairs, claiming colleagues indulged in excessive drinking with lobbyists, missed votes due to hangovers, and distributed voting cards like ""candy"" to permit others to vote on their behalf.

Islam does not hate us, as in America or the West or whatever, not any more than any other religion would.

And this is more proof that anyone who is voting for trump is voting for the kind of rhetoric that would turn an entire bigoted slice of his base against a group of people based on the religion they practice.

I'll admit that President Biden isn't perfect, but he's head and shoulders better than the twice-impeached hate monger who is only running for President to avoid prison.

I'll take four more years of President Biden over another nano second of the shit stain that is Donald trump."

Masks are dropping everywhere. I just don’t understand who our politicians are lying to and for anymore."
"I think you misunderstood my tweet. The UN was created (in large part) due to the United States pushing this false idea that international liberalism could work.
It can’t. The UN has always been a joke and the US has always known that, hence the reason we ourselves openly decide when to adhere to or ignore their policies. 
America has been in decline since we took on policing the world following world war 2. International liberalism has failed. 
It’s time to stop this performative overseas concept and return to national sovereignty."
"I still do not support sending a single American son, daughter, or dollar overseas to aid in a foreign war. 

And I’m getting really exhausted with people using emotional arguments to try to explain why it’s our perpetual duty to put Americans last."

If America doesn’t have to follow the rules or respect UN votes than the mask has dropped and countries will resort back to national sovereignty and the laws of the jungle.

"If you’d like to read further into Native American cannibalism, I invite you to read Rodney Stark’s “How the West Was Won”. Excellent book. 

If you prefer your trusted left-leaning sources, PBS and New York Times has written upon the matters and even the most cursory of google searches will pull up these facts. 

Again, I’m sorry life isn’t a Disney movie and Native Americans weren’t marching with Pride Flags."
"While shocking and vile, the well documented truth regarding native American cannibalism is not racist. 
What is racist is the perpetuated lie about Europeans committing genocide against them when in fact 90% were killed by the epidemic of small pox. Yes, the Europeans carried over the disease unwittingly but the resulting deaths of the natives, while sad, was not intentional.

What is similarly shocking and vile is that you are trying to rewrite tribal, Native American history to include this bizarre and perverted American chapter of trying to brainwash children to chop their genitals off."
"Yes, native Americans also did drugs and if all of this upsetting to you, you really should skip over the chapter regarding the Aztecs and child sacrifice. 

They weren’t trannies, but they were tribal and slaughtered en masse to honor temples."
"The Native Americans were not trannies. LOL. 
I cannot even believe students are learning this on university campuses. 

Also, yes, Native Americans did cannibalize one another.

Obsession slays discipline

"Setbacks & failures feel better than regret 100% of the time

When you experience setbacks and failures the anger and despair disappears

But the one thing that will torture your soul & keep you in purgatory is knowing you never tried"
"Many normies who bought lottery tickets yesterday talked themselves into truly believing they’d win

Never realizing if they could sustain that level of confidence and delusion they could build the fucking lottery for themselves"
"Join me in my Space! twitter.com/i/spaces/1ZkJzbj…"
"A lot of dudes push themselves physically as a cope for not being able to push themselves emotionally

Brutal workouts are easy in comparison.  But many many gym tough guys fall apart at the first sight of business or relationship adversity"
"Who wants @brutedeforce on my channel next?"
"There’s a reason every parent/teacher/psychologist tries so hard to correct ur flaws

Every last drop of power you have is in your quirks and your own way of doing things

People are terrified of men who embrace their own methods"
"Good habits only get you 80% of the way.  The last 20% requires very bad habits

Dysfunctional patterns of living no one could possibly understand but you.  Ur X factor. 

You remove all ur bad habits ur guaranteed to be average"
"It’s all over once you buy into the construct of being an adult

All humor goes out the window, u become a caricature who just pays bills & can never break that character

Gotta hide from having fun too.  No coming back from it"
"Obsessive personalities break all the rules & still win.  Overstimulated 24/7, no dopamine detox.  Massacring songs on repeat 400x in a row, chaingunning cigs all day, sex every day. Mind a constant tempest.  All roads to lead to Rome for the obsessed"
"Fever yesterday

Popped an advil, Zyn and HIIT workout then completed 10 hour block of work. 1 hour walk after this 

Slept 9 hours and Woke up feeling 100%

Regardless of circumstances it’s essential u must do what needs to get done on a daily basis

Homage: @brutedeforce"
"Natural progression of music is gangster rap as fuel when ur broke and ethereal house once you’ve stacked W’s

Hard to relate to the anger of Eminem when u made it"
"Very important to drive all your belongings into the ground.  They’re they’re to serve you. Why when you finally get that first scratch on ur new car ur relieved.  Now you can drive it like the maniac you wanted to be"
"One of the most scornful traits of modern “guys” is unwillingness to get their hands & feet dirty

Wont go to the beach cuz will track sand in car/house

Wont hike in the rain cuz 2 muddy

Wont climb a mountain cuz will fuck shoes up/rip clothes

Hands down gayest trait of em all"
"If you think poor people are broke cuz they’re lazy you’re wrong.  Nothing lazy about working 12 hour days in the retail pit

Being poor is a mental illness.  It’s all about convincing yourself other people deserve better than you & then hating them for it"
"One of the eternal truths that @brutedeforce speaks is that you have to be willing to lose everything to truly be free.

As Jesus said, “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”"
"I’ll add that it’s poetic as fuck that vegetating is a pejorative term to denote laziness.  Vegetables have zero power.  Another L for the vegans"
"If ur low on the totem pole you should never be vegetating in front of the tv or computer.  It quells all your anger.

Gotta learn to sit there staring at blank walls in ur own dissatisfaction.  U’ll start to get very pissed off at ur situation & leave no choice but to make moves"
"Makes sense that by nature the hardest shit to get is the most nutritional

U don’t get rewarded for plucking apples cause it’s too easy

Nature is always beckoning you toward difficulty to get what’s good for you"
"Planning has derailed way more lives than just winging it ever has"

"🚨NEWS: Federal prosecutors are working to secure a hefty sentence for a January 6th attacker who bragged about his assault on a police officer, literally showcasing his hands covered in the cop's blood.

""I fed him to the people,"" he said.

Jack Wade Whitton Jr. can be seen in photos and video assaulting officers, even beating some with a metal crutch and dragging an injured cop to the floor. During the melee, he can be heard yelling ""You're gonna die tonight!""

Prosecutors what Whitton Jr. slammed with a sentence of at least 97 months in prison and pay a fine of over $61,000.

Perhaps most damning was the evidence he produced against himself, as his own Instagram post shows his bloody hands and reads “This is from a bad cop. Yea I fed him to the people. Idk his status. And don’t care tbh.”

People like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who lament the treatment and prosecution of January 6th attackers, should be asked by reporters to defend or denounce the actions of specific people like Whitton Jr."
"Joe Biden negotiated the release of hostages from Hamas

Donald Trump negotiated the release of 5000 taliban soldiers."
"I remember watching the time go by as the violence continued, and wondering why he wouldn't make a statement to tell them to leave. Then we heard later that he told McCarthy “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.”

Unforgiveable."
"If you plan to refer to trump as insurrection inciter for the foreseeable future, then I suggest you follow us at @ReallyAmerican1 where we believe what he did was unprecedented and unforgiveable, and we hope history books judge him as accurately and harshly as we do."
"May all the other hostages join them soon. May the ICRC be allowed immediate access to all remaining hostages. May humanitarian aid reach everyone in Gaza. May we find leaders who can lead us out of this perpetual wilderness. May this be the first step toward a different future for Palestinians, Israelis, and us all."
"Lyin' Ted: It has been over 24 hours since New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the Rainbow Bridge incident was not terror related, and Senator Ted Cruz still has this post up.

Cruz wrote ""This confirms our worst fear: the explosion at Rainbow Bridge was a terrorist attack.""

Even Community Notes from X has weighed in, and reiterated that it was an accident, not a terrorist attack.

Is Ted Cruz just lazy, or is he lying?"

"I was pissed when a Colorado judge refused to take trump off of the ballot for insurrection.

But then that SAME judge confirmed that trump “engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement,” so it's official: he is an insurrectionist.

70 year old guy next to me: “Florida. But I had to leave the mainland when Trump won.”

Me: “that’s interesting, what didn’t you like about Trump?”

Him: “he doesn’t want the rich to pay their fair share. Look at what the rich are doing to americas cities — like San Francisco! It used to be perfect but now the wealthy have ignored the poor in the city and it’s fallen apart. That’s the f****** country Trump wants.”

I declined to attend these events but I am sharing this experience now to underscore just how severe indoctrination has become across college campuses. Professors will literally offer to improve your grade if you attend a protest or “get involved” in a variety of their left-leaning causes. 

In this same class, the assigned textbook stated that Donald Trump gassed protesters on his way to visit the church during BLM riots. 
It was a literal printed lie in a university textbook. I of course argued with my professor and the students who were convinced it did actually take place. 

People do not realize the state of college campuses today and how nearly impossible it is for students not to fall victim to the lies they are learning in their classrooms."

""NO JURY ALLOWED, A STATUTE NEVER USED FOR THIS BEFORE, A RIGGED TRIAL, A RACIST & CORRUPT ATTORNEY GENERAL, A TRUMP HATING JUDGE, ELECTION INTERFERENCE!"" Trump spewed.

"As a Christian, here are three reasons why you should support Donald Trump for president again in 2024: 

1) Trump fights for religious liberty - As president, he signed numerous executive orders defending religious liberty. He cares about your right to live by your values, pray freely, and the church’s right to speak truth to culture. 

2) Trump supports the nation of Israel - As president, he kept his campaign promise to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Others promised this, but he delivered. 

3) Trump is staunchly pro-life - He is the first president to speak at the March For Life Rally in D.C., and he appointed three Supreme Court Justices that overturned Roe V. Wade. He is the most pro-life president America has ever had. 

President Trump is the candidate with the best chance to win the general election who has a proven track record of fighting for our Judeo-Christian values."

"🚨BREAKING: Fulton County DA Fani Willis personally questions Trump co-defendant Harrison Floyd, seeking to revoke his bond amid accusations of intimidating witnesses through social media posts. 

Floyd, indicted with Trump in the Georgia election interference case, faces a state racketeering charge and two felony counts for alleged involvement in a scheme to intimidate elections worker Ruby Freeman.

Willis filed a motion last week, alleging Floyd's breach of release terms. His lawyers argue the social media posts weren't intimidating, emphasizing Trump's similar posts with no repercussions. They challenge the state's decision, deeming it hard to justify given the lack of action against Trump.

The unprecedented move by DA Willis to directly question Floyd suggests heightened scrutiny, signaling the seriousness of the allegations. 

The case takes a contentious turn as the defense points to Trump's influence on social media, questioning the consistency in the legal response to similar behaviors."

"I am currently on a college campus tour. The number one topic on students’ minds, and the number one radical position they defend is transgenderism. 
Do I honestly believe that these 18 year olds students are fighting me because they legitimately want to see children’s genitals permanently mutilated? 
No. 
They are being systematically brainwashed by the school system and they truly believe that they are fighting to help kids. They are dangerously wrong and unwittingly supporting violence. 
But I do not want these students put on a blacklist. I want to face these students, as a mother, and to help them understand the abhorrence of what they are mindlessly supporting."
"You’re attempting snark, but as a matter of fact, I almost exclusively hired reformed BLM activists to work for my charity, BLEXIT. They actually proved to be the most dedicated employees to the cause because the mission was personal to them. 

Students can change. I am living proof of it. Cultural propaganda coupled with educational brainwash has proven potent, but not irreversible. 

I don’t mind your ire directed toward their administrators and professors (the root cause of their madness) but you are being entirely disingenuous when it comes to the students. 

You know the majority of them don’t want grandmas dead no more than I wanted grandmas dead when I refused to wear a mask during covid propaganda season. 

If we’re being honest, the majority of them can’t even point out Israel on a map."
"I will again restate that is unlikely that the majority of the college kids were taking to the streets to  explicitly “cheer murdered babies”. They instead believe they are fighting for some other righteous cause. While misguided, they are in need of education, not black lists. 

I would also like to highlight your inherent pettiness and immaturity for tagging the Daily Wire."
"I started my political career at Turning Point USA for a reason because I intimately understood how the left had brainwashed me to hold what I now recognize were the wrong positions on virtually everything— from race to human life. 
Turning Point held the righteous idea that conservatives could win on the basis of our ideas, showing up to debate and changing minds on University campuses.
If instead their prevailing philosophy was “all leftist students are irredeemable and should be put on a list for not agreeing with us”, I would have never joined the organization. 
Conservatives are losing the plot. 
While I passionately disagree with these students on virtually every issue, putting leftist students on blacklists will all but guarantee that they hold resentment and never come over to our side on any issue. 

That isn’t a solution, it’s a future problem."
"It’s one of my biggest gripes with the pro-life movement to this day. They call young women “baby murderers” as if these young women aren’t systematically learning in school that it’s a clump of cells and that it would be selfish of them to carry through with their pregnancies. 

Hysterical rhetoric and heavy accusations never helps to bring people to your side. Both the left and the right are guilty of it."
"Nothing infuriated me more than watching black neighborhoods be burned to the ground in terroristic fashion during the George Floyd riots. But I would have been a disingenuous fool had I suggested that every college kid who signed a BLM letter of support be put on a list for advocating for terrorism. They were brainwashed and it was obvious. Rather than advocating for them to have their lives ruined I used my platform to show them the truth. I created a documentary to expose media lies. 

Education is what conquers ignorance. 

Many of my former critics are fans now and virtually nobody is donating to the now bankrupted BLM organization."
"Oh stop it. This is incredibly disingenuous, Megyn. 
You know that many of those students are not out there because they want babies to be murdered. 
College kids are stupid. I used to be radically pro-choice. Glad I didn’t get put on a “conservative” black list for wanting babies murdered. As it turned out, I was just young and temporarily brainwashed from a public school education coupled with mainstreamed Hollywood lies— and not because I legitimately wanted to see infants torn from their mothers’ wombs. 
Dr. Thomas Sowell used to be a radical socialist who ardently supported communism. Thankfully he wasn’t put on a “conservative” blacklist and accused of being a person who wanted worldwide suffering and starvation, as socialism and communism bring.
Students are young and experimenting. You are an adult woman who is advocating for their lives to be permanently pigeonholed because they have the wrong ideas which are likely being spoon fed to them in their classrooms."
"The rhetoric of the elite is becoming more insane and more unhinged with every geopolitical issue. 

Why? 

Our enemies are growing stronger—regarding that there can be no doubt. No one is being convinced by hysteria amongst the elites that we are somehow justified in our pursuits so why do they continue to do it? 

Why do they seem to actually WANT a third world war?"
"This is very much worth the read and a subsequent discussion. 
While I don’t agree with every point, it very much articulates how I felt watching the faux moral crusading over Ukraine being forced upon us from the elites. 
Why? 
Because the West has lost the moral high ground."
"This is such a commendable tweet.

"Why do people love Tucker Carlson? 

The older class of the Republican Party doesn’t know how to deal with the fact that younger conservatives are not reacting emotionally—mindlessly agreeing to pledge billions of dollars or to enter foreign wars—no matter how shrill the screams from politicians.

Every war and every tax dollar spent overseas requires a full-throated debate. 

No amount of ad hominem attacks makes that  requirement disappear. 

You are not a racist or an antisemite or an islamophobe if you did not immediately acquiesce to a severe foreign policy decision based on graphic images being shared by either side. 

Tucker Carlson gets this. 

I remain a huge fan."

"This is DISGUSTING, even for Trump:

Former President Trump mocked former President Jimmy Carter at an Iowa event, just one day after the Carter family revealed Rosalynn Carter's entry into hospice care. 

Trump, criticizing Biden in Fort Dodge, Iowa, quipped, ""the happiest person anywhere in this country right now is Jimmy Carter because his administration looked brilliant compared to these clowns."" 

He added, ""Compared to Biden, Jimmy Carter was a brilliant, brilliant president.""

The Carter Center announced the former first lady's hospice care last week, a service often chosen by patients nearing the end of life. 

President Carter entered hospice care in February, and in May, the family confirmed Rosalynn Carter's dementia diagnosis. 

While Trump's remarks drew attention, they occurred against the backdrop of the Carter family dealing with Rosalynn Carter's health challenges. 

The former first lady's passing, following her entry into hospice, adds a somber note to the political commentary, emphasizing the importance of sensitivity when discussing public figures, particularly during personal and challenging times.

Notably, the Carters enjoyed a 77-year loving and faithful marriage, with neither facing felony charges nor attempting to incite insurrection against America."
"Happy Birthday Mr. President!!!

"Moms for Liberty Not Sending Their Best: 

Philadelphia's Moms for Liberty chapter faces scrutiny as their faith-based outreach coordinator, Phillip Fisher Jr., a Republican pastor, was convicted a decade ago of sexually abusing a teenager. 

Leading the Center of Universal Divinity, Fisher connects the group with local faith leaders to boost membership. Shockingly, Fisher pleaded guilty in 2012 to aggravated sexual abuse of a 14-year-old when he was 25.

Blaming a political action committee tied to Lyndon LaRouche, Fisher alleges a conspiracy, calling it a ""railroad job."" Despite his conviction, he leads the right-wing group's outreach. 

Moms for Liberty's national spokesperson did not comment, leaving Sheila Armstrong, a GOP ward leader, expressing surprise over Fisher's background, unaware as she obtained a ""child abuse history certification"" for him.

Fisher served nearly 20 months in jail before pleading guilty to the three-year sentence, citing violence from fellow inmates as motivation. His past is accessible on the Illinois State Police sex offender database and the U.S. Department of Justice's National Sex Offender Website. 

This revelation poses challenges for Moms for Liberty, raising questions about their vetting process if they're hiring convicted sex offenders for outreach when that information is readily accessible."

"Rest in peace to former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who sadly passed away at age 96, with President Carter right by her side.

She helped revolutionize the role of FLOTUS, and she was referred to as “The Steel Magnolia,” as she was at one point considered possibly the most powerful First Lady in U. S. history. 

President Carter sent her on major diplomatic missions and often had her join cabinet meetings. 

One of President Carter's aides had listed his top advisers, and put her above Secretary of State, National Security Adviser and White House Chief of Staff. A Time magazine columnist wrote, “Note the order.”

She was the first with an office and issues staff, and steered policy on many issues, including mental health. 

Rosalynn Carter gave her first address to the World Health Organization, and stated that health is a human right and called attention to mental health as a critical part of a person's well-being.

Rest in Power, FLOTUS. 🙏💙"

Re:  Judicial Complaint Against Judge Arthur F. Engoron
Supreme Court, New York County
Case Name: New York v. Trump
Index No.: 452564/2022

Dear Commission Members:

On November 10, I filed an ethics complaint against Judge Arthur F. Engoron.

Please supplement my complaint with President Donald J. Trump's publicly available mistrial motion he filed on November 15, which I have enclosed and Judge Engoron just wrongly denied.

Sincerely,
Elise M. Stefanik

"My friend @LauraLoomer has really triggered the desantis “influencers” today because she exposed the fact the “influencers” are bought and paid for.

DeSantis has no organic support and his “influencers” are non-influential hence why he has fallen into 5th place in NH and third place everywhere else.

Keep up the great work, LL! MAGA! 🇺🇸"

"If January 6th was such a peaceful gathering and NOT an insurrection, why was domestic terrorist Ashli Babbitt shot while trying to climb through a window busted by ""peaceful tourists?""

Why were people trying to gouge the eyes out of police officers?

Why were both Republican and Democratic members of Congress forced to shelter in place while people tried to bash the doors in?

Why was there a gallows brought there while people chanted ""hang Mike Pence?""

Why did they evacuate Mike Pence?

Why was Josh Hawley running for his carpetbagging life? 

Why was fecal matter smeared on the walls?

Why did Laura Ingraham and Don Jr frantically try to get Mark Meadows to get trump to stop the violence?

So many questions."

"I've noticed that there is a huge disparity in which content is considered sensitive on this site in the past year, and it's disturbing.

The replies to my tweets are filled with troll accounts that repeatedly post content that is supposed to be in violation of Twitter rules, replies using homophobic slurs, threatening violence -- and Twitter keeps saying ""we didn't find it in violation blah blah""

Meanwhile, I see dozens of replies to me that are completely innocuous, tweets that are flagged to contain ""sensitive content"" when it's only a GIF saying ""Democracy Rules"" or someone high-fiving.

It's clear that Musk is busy promoting hateful, antisemitic content and he's punishing left wing content.

I hope Media Matters and other outlets get to the bottom of what's really going on."

"🚨Trump's Fraud Witness FLOPS: Like everything else in his orbit, Donald Trump's defense is unraveling miserably in his civil fraud trial in New York City, as an expert witness, Steven Laposa, seemingly contradicted himself under intense cross-examination. 

Laposa, who was testifying in favor of Trump, aimed to refute what he labeled as the State's ""flawed"" interpretation of Trump's financial documents, as reported by ABC News.

The real estate expert had previously argued that the State mistakenly relied on the market value of Trump properties, claiming it to be significantly lower than their actual investment value. 

However, on Friday, Attorney General Letitia James' attorney, Louis Solomon, pulled out Trump's financial document and demanded Laposa read from its notes section. 

Shockingly, the note stated, ""Assets are stated at their estimated current values,"" leading Laposa to admit, ""First time I've seen this.""

Solomon then confronted Laposa with a definition of ""Estimated Current Value"" and questioned whether it was the same as market value. In a stunning revelation, Laposa replied, ""It could be."" 

This revelation directly contradicted his earlier stance. The tension escalated when Solomon presented a video deposition from July 19, 2023, where Laposa had unequivocally testified that the two terms were synonymous.

The implications of Laposa's flip-flop are substantial, considering that the trial revolves around Attorney General James' $250 million complaint, alleging that Trump inflated the value of his assets to deceive lenders and investors. 

While Trump vehemently denies any wrongdoing, the judge had already found him liable for fraud in a summary judgment. The trial, now taking an unexpected twist, has shifted focus to the crucial task of determining damages."

No amount of retaliation will feel like enough.
No amount of suffering on either side is justifiable.

Hamas needs to be eliminated.
Netanyahu needs to lose his job.
Palestine needs leadership that will push for a two-state solution.
The United States, and major Arab states, need to help make it happen.

Antisemitism and Islamophobia are BOTH wrong.
This conflict needs thoughtful, wise voices.
It doesn't need ignorant, hateful voices.

There are voices on BOTH sides that are trying to amp up the rhetoric to a dangerous, deadly pitch.

Don't be part of the problem.
Be part of the solution."

"🚨NEWS: In a bombshell lawsuit, ex-Fox News producer Jason Donner alleges he was fired for resisting false narratives about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. 

Donner claims he was part of a targeted ""purge"" for refusing to toe the line to ""appease"" Trump and his election-denying base. 

Donner was inside the Capitol during the chaos he personally witnessed, so naturally he confronted Fox's misleading reports of ""peaceful"" protesters, even calling the control room in a desperate attempt to correct the record, saying “you’re gonna get us all killed,” according to the lawsuit. 

He didn't stop there—he also debunked Tucker Carlson's ""Patriot Purge"" on Fox Nation, revealing the network's alleged complicity in pushing false narratives. 

The lawsuit details Fox's prioritization of Trump-supporting viewers, sidelining concerns about accuracy in favor of appeasing a specific audience.

Ultimately, Donner claims he was unfairly targeted and fired for his dissent. Accused of irresponsibility for taking sick leave during COVID-19 vaccine recovery, he alleges discrimination based on political views. 

It bears noting that Fox News is already on the hook for almost $800 million dollars to settle a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for defamation. 

Donner, once a Republican turned Democrat, seeks unspecified damages, further exposing the internal turmoil at Fox News."
"I know I would never vote for someone who referred to me, my neighbors, or ANY human beings as ""vermin.""

"🚨🚨JUST IN: The House Ethics Committee's report on Rep. George Santos (R-NY) was just released, revealing ""potential violations of federal criminal law,"" prompting a referral to the Department of Justice. 

The committee's statement asserted ""substantial evidence"" indicating Santos knowingly filed false FEC reports, misused campaign funds for personal use, engaged in fraudulent conduct with RedStone Strategies LLC, and willfully violated the Ethics in Government Act related to his Financial Disclosure Statements.

This development intensifies the controversy surrounding Santos, already facing 23 federal criminal counts and surviving two expulsion attempts, with a third looming.

The report underscores serious allegations, heightening scrutiny on Santos' ethical and legal conduct. The referral to the Department of Justice amplifies the legal challenges for Santos, further jeopardizing his political standing.

Santos has steadfastly insisted that he will resist demands for him to resign, while even a plurality of his constituents and fellow New York members of Congress want him gone. 

""Like I said before, I'm staying in office for sure,"" he said. ""I will take whatever comes my way, the way it comes."""

"So-called “moderate” Republican Nikki Haley puts on full display how extreme she really is.

In response to Sean Hannity asking her if she will, as President, cut ties with “these globalist organizations”, Haley says that she would:

- Remove the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council.
- Keep the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord.
- Withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization.
- Help defund the United Nations by scaling back our commitments there.

- Resuming military to military contact
- Discussed the impact of artificial intelligence

- Peace and stability in the Taiwan straits"

"This is HILARIOUS:

Donald Trump's thin-skinned and petty nature has been well-documented, so it's no surprise that his latest outburst of anger on his failing social media platform involves him begging one celebrity after being rejected by another.

Jonathan Karl's latest book, ""Tired of Winning,"" is the latest target of Trump's Truth Social fury, where he called the book ""very boring."" 

But he also lashes out at Kim Kardashian, as one of the book's anecdotes says Trump begged her to introduce him to football players in exchange for his commuting the sentence of certain prisoners.

Trump's fixation on football players seems to have stemmed from Trump suffering a humiliating rejection by the New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick when he declined to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump.

Belichick, who described himself as ""an American citizen with great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy,"" was disgusted by the events of January 6th and hence wanted nothing to do with the disgraced President.

So in the final days of his presidency, Kardashian attempted to secure pardons for some prisoners as part of her criminal justice reform campaign. But Trump, still hurting over Belichick's rejection, wanted a quid pro quo of introducing him to her football-playing friends.

In his angry Truth Social denial, Trump claims he had no trouble getting players to come to the White House, despite the fact that 10 out of 20 teams refused to attend, and even members of the team who did attend the White House refused to come.

While President Biden is focused on domestic and international concerns, Trump is focused on the small, petty things."

During the hearing, Mullin had been reading ""mean tweets"" posted by Teamsters President Sean O'Brien when he suddenly proposed that they settle their differences with a bare-knuckles brawl, which Senator Bernie Sanders defused, despite Mullins' repeated attempts to schedule a fight.

Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed Mullin, asking him why ""woke"" society wouldn't let him settle the dispute with his fists like in the good ole days, and Mullin blamed it on ""political correctness.""

“All of a sudden you got to worry about somebody’s feelings but oh, by the way, the left can say whatever they want,” Mullin said.

It should be noted that Senator Mullin fought in three mixed martial arts fights. He lost all 3. His total fight time was less than 10 minutes, and he fought a total of less than three full rounds."

"🚨🚨🚨 I just filed an official judicial complaint against Judge Arthur Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York’s disgraceful lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization.

Americans are sick and tired of the blatant corruption by radical Leftist judges in NY. All New Yorkers must speak out against the dangerous weaponized lawfare against President Trump. Read my full complaint below.

November 10, 2023

New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct
61 Broadway, Suite 1200
New York, New York 10006

Re:      Judicial Complaint Against Judge Arthur F. Engoron
Supreme Court, New York County
Case Name:    New York v. Trump
Index No.:       452564/2022

Dear Commission Members:

I write today to express my serious concerns about the inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance shown by Judge Arthur F. Engoron in New York’s lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization. This judge’s bizarre behavior has no place in our judicial system, where Judge Engoron is not honoring the defendant’s rights to due process and a fair trial. These serious concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is the leading candidate for President of the United States, and it appears the judicial system is being politicized to affect the outcome of the campaign.

Simply put, Judge Engoron has displayed a clear judicial bias against the defendant throughout the case, breaking several rules in the New York Code of Judicial Conduct.

Last year, Judge Engoron told President Trump’s attorney that the former president is “just a bad guy” who Democrat New York Attorney General Letitia James “should go after as the chief law enforcement officer of the state.”[1]

At the start of the trial, Judge Engoron infamously smiled and posed for the cameras.[2] After the defendant won an appellate ruling against Judge Engoron on the appropriate statute of limitations in this case, the judge simply ignored the ruling.[3] Judge Engoron entered summary judgment against the defendant before the trial even began, without witnesses, other evidence, and cross-examination. This, despite the fact there’s disputed material evidence–and there’s no victim of the defendant’s supposed fraud. Indeed, as the trial evidence has made clear, the defendant paid back the sophisticated Wall Street banks, on time, in full, with interest, as agreed.[4] No insurance company paid a penny. And these banks and insurance companies, supposedly defrauded, continue to do business with the defendant. Yet Judge Engoron decreed before trial the defendant somehow committed fraud. Now, the judge is holding a trial–with no jury–to determine how much of Tish James’ requested $250 million in damages–with no victims–he will extract from the defendant. How does this not violate the defendant’s Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial?

And Judge Engoron has made it crystal clear he doesn’t care what the defendant or his attorneys have to say. Indeed, Judge Engoron illegally gagged them. Judge Engoron told the defendant: “We are not here to listen to what you have to say.” He told the defendant’s counsel: “I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!” And Judge Engoron even threatened the defendant’s counsel if he filed a routine motion for a directed verdict: “You better not, Chris!”

Judge Engoron and his staff are partisan Democrat donors. As recently as 2018, Judge Engoron donated to the Manhattan Democrats[5]–even though Section 100.5 says that judges “shall refrain” from “making a contribution to a political organization.”[6]

Section 100.5 also stipulates that a “judge shall prohibit members of the judge’s staff” from contributing more than $500 “in the aggregate during any calendar year to all political campaigns for political office.”[7] Allison Greenfield has served as Judge Engoron's principal law clerk since 2019.[8] In both 2022 and 2023, Greenfield donated in excess of $500 to political campaigns. In 2022 alone, Greenfield donated “$3,335 in political donations to Democrat candidates and causes.”[9] She’s already given more than $1,000 in 2023 to campaigns.[10] When President Trump’s attorneys notified Judge Engoron, Judge Engoron responded by issuing an illegal gag order against President Trump’s legal team.[11]

Judge Engoron has gone on to gag and fine President Trump for merely criticizing Judge Engoron’s law clerk, which is core political speech protected by the First Amendment.[12] If anyone in America must have the constitutional right to speak out against the judge, his staff, the witnesses, or the process, it’s a defendant going through a process he believes is politicized and weaponized against him. To gag a defendant is un-American. It’s an illegal prior restraint on the defendant’s First Amendment rights, which even the progressive ACLU felt compelled to acknowledge after another Democrat judge–D.C. Obama U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan–illegally gagged President Trump.[13] Indeed, three Democrat-appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit have since stayed Judge Chutkan’s illegal gag order.[14]

Judge Engoron put his judgment in serious doubt by issuing a summary judgment citing as evidence of fraud that the Trump Organization said Mar-a-Lago is worth between $426 and $612 million.[15] The Associated Press reported that two top Palm Beach-area real estate agents said that the club’s “sale of a billion dollars or more would be possible.”[16]

In fact, Judge Engoron ridiculously found Mar-a-Lago was only worth somewhere between $18 and $27.6 million. Any Zillow.com search shows that nearly 20 acres of prime real estate in Palm Beach, touching both the Atlantic Ocean and the intracoastal waterway, is worth exponentially more than $18 and $27.6 million. And Judge Engoron had in his hand the sworn deposition of Palm Beach real estate agent Lawrence Moens, who said the Trump Organization’s valuations were “reasonable and below my estimate for the market value of the property each year.”[17] Moens was asked in his sworn deposition about what sort of buyers would purchase Mar-a-Lago, and Moens responded: “I could dream up anyone from Elon Musk to Bill Gates and everyone in between. Kings, emperors, heads of state. But with net worths in the multiple billions.”[18] The judge wrote: “Obviously this Court cannot consider an ‘expert affidavit’ that is based on unexplained and unsubstantiated ‘dream[s].’”[19] Judge Engoron apparently doesn’t understand that expert opinions aren’t “dreams.” And this is yet another example why Judge Engoron demonstrated bad judgment by keeping this case, instead of sending it to the expert judges in the Commercial Division where it belongs.[20]

Judge Engoron’s bizarre and biased behavior is making New York’s judicial system a laughingstock. Former Southern District of New York federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, who has at times criticized President Trump, recently stated that he views the “whole New York justice system” as “fraudulent.”[21]

Section 100.2(A) states: “A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.”[22] Judge Engoron has grossly failed to do this. The Commission’s sanctions against Judge Engoron are necessary to bring back credibility to our great state’s legal system. All Americans, including political opponents, must receive due process and equal protection under our U.S. and New York Constitutions. Judge Engoron’s disdain for President Trump and his politics are evident, and the Commission must take corrective action to restore a just process and protect our constitutional rights. Judge Engoron must recuse from this case.

This case is so much bigger than President Donald J. Trump. If Judge Engoron can railroad a billionaire New York businessman, a former President of the United States, and the leading presidential candidate, just imagine what he could do to all New Yorkers. Judge Engoron’s lawlessness sends an ominous and illegal warning to New York business owners: If New York judges don’t like your politics, they will destroy your business, the livelihood of your employees, and you personally. This Commission cannot let this continue.

Thank you for your prompt consideration of this judicial complaint against Judge Arthur F. Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York v. Trump (452564/2022).

Sincerely,

Elise M. Stefanik

"Karen Reynolds failed Republicans across the country by neglecting her job as Chairwoman of the RGA.

She left Republican Gubernatorial candidates terribly underfunded because she was focused on campaigning with Rob DeSantis, a man who wears higher heels and more makeup than her, instead of raising money for Republicans.

She should be ashamed of herself!"
"DeSantis’ running mate, Karen Reynolds, the wildly unpopular governor of Iowa, is in charge of the Republicans Governor’s association for this cycle.

Instead of working really hard to help Republican gubernatorial candidates like @DanielCameronAG raise money, she spent the last few months parading Rob DeSantis throughout Iowa.

Now Karen and Rob are blaming Trump. It’s almost as if Karen deliberately failed to do her job and wanted to sabotage Republicans. Not cool!"
"DeSantis has spent close to $100M on his failing effort to take down Trump.

DeSantis doesn’t care about the country, he only cares about himself.

@DanielCameronAG was a great candidate who ran an incredible race. He came very close in a state that has only had two Republican governors in the last 50 years.

Cameron has a great political future and I’m excited to see what he does next!"

WTF is wrong with Republicans?"
"LMAO, Kevin McCarthy physically assaulted Rep. Tim Burchett in the hallway and then ran away from him, this is the cowardly, chaotic GOP folks.

Republicans are in disarray."
"🚨BREAKING: Failed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was chased by one of the 8 Republicans who voted to oust him, after McCarthy reportedly elbowed him in the back.

Reporters on Capitol Hill witnessed a physical altercation between Rep. McCarthy and Rep. Tim Burchett in the Capitol. Burchett accused McCarthy of giving him a ""shove"" with his elbow, prompting a confrontation. ""Why'd you elbow me in the back Kevin?!"" exclaimed Burchett. 

Burchett, visibly upset, labeled McCarthy a ""jerk"" and expressed surprise at the uncharacteristically aggressive behavior.

As the exchange escalated, a chase ensued with Burchett pursuing McCarthy and his detail. Burchett continued questioning McCarthy's actions, demanding an explanation for the alleged elbow. 

Despite McCarthy's denial, Burchett stood firm, asserting, ""You got no guts, you did so."" McCarthy eventually walked away while Burchett criticized him as ""childish"" and ""a jerk.""

Remarkably, this incident marks the first communication between the two since Burchett voted in favor of a motion to vacate the speaker's chair earlier this year, but it tracks with McCarthy's unfortunate but accurate reputation for being ""spineless."""
"🚨Another HUGE loss for Trump: 

Donald Trump flops again as recent filings unveil Truth Social, his social media venture, with an astonishing $73 million loss since its 2022 launch.

The company's abysmal performance is underscored by meager net sales, reaching only $1.4 million in its inaugural year and $2.3 million in the first half 2023. These dismal figures expose Trump's shortcomings as a businessman, contradicting the persona he has crafted to his supporters.

The disheartening revelation stems from a filing by Digital World Acquisition Corp, the SPAC set to merge with Truth Social’s parent company TMTG. The filing explicitly raises concerns about TMTG's viability, casting doubt on its ability to sustain operations. 

This financial downturn reinforces the perception that his businessman brand is a bust, and everything he touches dies."

"Good morning and Happy Monday to everyone who prefers Presidents who DON'T use the word ""vermin"" to dehumanize people, the same way Hitler and Mussolini used to use that word.

That should be disqualifying for presidential candidates. Inciting insurrection should be too."
"🚨🚨MAJOR BREAKING: In a groundbreaking move, the Supreme Court announces its adoption of a code of ethics, a response to persistent Democratic criticism of perceived corruption among Republican justices. 

However, skeptics question the authenticity of this ethical commitment, deeming it a potential PR stunt to salvage the court's tarnished reputation. 

The ethical framework is met with skepticism, especially considering long-standing allegations of impropriety, such as the acceptance of bribes by Republicans like Clarence Thomas.

Critics dismiss the notion that a nonbinding code will prompt a sudden ethical transformation among justices with a history of questionable conduct. 

The justices, including Thomas, assert that they have always adhered to ethical standards. However, this claim is met with skepticism given the mounting evidence of impropriety.

The justices contend that the absence of a formal code led to a ""misunderstanding"" about their ethical standards. The newly introduced code is positioned as a clarification of principles governing their conduct. 

Critics argue that the move is an attempt to rewrite history rather than a genuine commitment to ethical behavior, especially in the face of allegations of bribery and corruption.

While the introduction of an ethics code is deemed a positive step, demands for accountability persist. 

Some argue that the only appropriate response to address the cloud of impropriety is for Clarence Thomas to resign, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive actions beyond the adoption of a code of ethics."

"🚨🚨NEWS: In the ongoing $250 million fraud trial led by New York Attorney General Letitia James against Donald Trump and his family business, Donald Trump Jr. took the stand for the second time and possibly jeopardized the defense with his boneheaded bragging. 

The outcome of the civil trial against the Trump Organization has already been largely determined as fraud has already been determined, but the phase it's in now is to determine the amount of financial liability.

Don Jr's testimony took a controversial turn as he admitted, under oath, that it was a ""mistake"" for the Trump family not to pursue new deals while Donald Trump was president. 

Trump Jr. stated, ""In retrospect, that was probably a mistake,"" emphasizing the perceived lack of credit for their business activities during the presidency.

Ironically, Trump Jr. contradicted himself moments later by acknowledging that he initiated work on ""bigger picture deals"" shortly after his father's inauguration in 2017. This inconsistency raises questions about the transparency of the Trump family's business activities during Trump's presidency.

Notably, Trump Jr. failed to address the numerous allegations of enrichment during Trump's presidency, amounting to a staggering $2.4 billion, as reported by Forbes.

This included deals with state-owned companies in China, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea, as well as controversial arrangements like a Chinese state-owned company's involvement in a Trump golf course in Dubai amid a U.S.-China trade war.

The broader scope of Trump's financial intertwining with his presidency became evident, with Politico reporting instances where Trump promoted his properties, attempted to host the G-7 summit at his resort, and the extensive use of taxpayer money for Secret Service expenses at Trump properties.

Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, further raised eyebrows by sealing a massive $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia shortly after Trump's departure from the White House in early 2023. 

These revelations underscore the intricate web of business and politics that characterized the Trump administration, and they merely scratch at the surface of the deep reserves of corruption lying underneath."

"BREAKING: Despite having a gag order in place and being fined multiple times, Trump opens his mouth yet again and launches another attack on the prosecutors and investigators pursuing him.

""Deranged Jack Smith, Andrew Weissman, Lisa Monaco, the 'team of losers and misfits' from CREW, and all the rest of the Radical Left Zealots and Thugs who have been working illegally for years to 'take me down', will end up, because of their suffering from a horrible disease, TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME (TDS!), in a Mental Institution by the time my next term as President is successfully completed.

"Donald Trump's anti-Veteran rhetoric extends way before his awful ""vermin"" Veterans' Day message. He's called fallen Vets ""suckers and losers,"" and blocked amputated Vets from parades because he said ""who wants to see that?""

Jack Smith: I don’t want them

"WOW, he truly is insane and delusional.

According to new reporting by Jonathan Karl, despite clearly losing the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump apparently came to actually believe a fringe conspiracy theory that he could be reinstated well after leaving office and before the next election.

Trump has been publicly airing his grievances over the last presidential election, and frequently repeats false claims that it was ""stolen."" But Trump apparently became fixated on a far-right theory that he could actually replace President Joe Biden after he was inaugurated.

The idea was not based in any actual law law and was clearly unconstitutional. But it was prominently supported by some of Trump's most devout followers, including MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell.

In June 2021, the Trump put out a statement that included the phrase ""2024 or before!"" at the end.

In a phone call the next month, he was pressed on what he meant by that.

""You don't really think there's a way you would get reinstated before the next election?"" Trump was asked by Jonathan Karl.

""I'm not going to explain it to you, Jonathan, because you wouldn't -- you wouldn't either understand it or write it,"" Trump said.

Karl learned that Trump was talking in private a lot about the baseless notion of being reinstated as President -- so much so that some of his advisers became concerned that he actually believed he could somehow force Biden out of the White House before the next election.

Even his own lawyer, Jenna Ellis had to publicly rebuke it. She tweeted in 2021:  ""The Constitution has only one process for removal of a sitting president: impeachment and conviction. No, President Trump is not going to be 'reinstated.'""

But that didn't and doesn't stop the former President from being deluded into believing he can somehow become president without winning the next election."
"Incidentally, many people tend to forget that at this point in the first term of his presidency, President Obama was losing to a generic Republican candidate in opinion polls, before being reelected. 

What a difference a year makes.
news.gallup.com/poll/150116/…"
"Is President Biden perfect? No.
Should we be concerned about polls? ALSO no.

It's too far out, a full year, before the 2024 election, and a lot can change. But President Biden is the most legislatively successful President in recent history, and he's still racking up wins."
"If you're sick of the way the media pushes their false narratives in order to secure more clicks and views, I suggest you follow us at @ReallyAmerican1 where we are keeping track of the enthusiasm and optimism around President Biden and Democrats, because it matters."
"To be clear: this is NOT partisan fearmongering. Everything Psaki says here is clearly outlined in Trump's Project 2025. There's a website and everything. He's saying it publicly. 
Act accordingly."
"I'm curious:

The media is busy creating a narrative that implies the support for President Biden is lackluster, so they can have a horse race that boosts their ratings.

If a pollster called you, who else ENTHUSIASTICALLY supports President Biden for reelection? 🤚"
"Good morning and Happy Sunday to everyone who rolled their eyes seeing pro-Veteran sentiments on Veterans Day, knowing damn well those SAME House Republicans don't mind our soldiers marching into harms way, but vote against Veterans benefits.

“To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts with [the amendment], Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative,” said a mix of Republican lawmakers. “The Ohio legislature alone will consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws based on public hearings and input from legal experts on both sides.”

The statement also included unsubstantiated references to “foreign election interference” by billionaires before voters enshrined abortion rights in Ohio’s constitution.

"Trump supporter claims we were better under him are insane. President Biden created more jobs in 2 years than Trump in four, he hit a 4.9% GDP when Trump didn't hit 3%. Violent crimes and unemployment are down.

"Let Them Fight: The knives are out as the ugly, ongoing feud between Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Lauren Boebert (R-CO) has escalated, with Taylor Greene reportedly openly using the derogatory term ""whore"" to describe her congressional colleague. 

The tensions came to a head during the House speaker election, where the two found themselves on opposing sides after the 2022 midterm elections.

According to reports by Zachary Petrizzo from the Daily Beast, Taylor Greene has consistently used the offensive term to refer to Boebert, even in conversations with Donald Trump. 

A Republican lawmaker, familiar with Taylor Greene's use of the term, stated, ""Calling her a whore, that’s not new. She’s been doing that for a while.”

When confronted about these accusations by the Daily Beast, Taylor Greene responded defensively, questioning the motives behind the story. ""Why are you working on a story? Because you like to write trash, you just can’t help yourself,"" she remarked. 

Despite the direct inquiry, Taylor Greene neither confirmed nor denied the use of the term but instead criticized the reporting.

Her dismissive response included, ""You just love it so much, you got to create it, and make it more, and bigger, and nastier,” leaving the allegations unanswered. 

The exchange highlights the deepening animosity between the two Republican lawmakers and the challenges of addressing such conflicts within the party.

Republicans remain in disarray."

"TWEEPS: Veterans have fought and died for us to exercise our rights to participate in civic duty and vote.

"It needs to be noted that, by contrast, not only did trump visit a non-union shop, during his speech he told workers that they should NOT pay their union dues and leave the union, that their efforts were doomed to fail.  trump is undefeated at getting things wrong."

"🚨BREAKING: Republicans suffer a HUGE setback to their fundraising hopes as Billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel says he won't be making any political donations to any races in the chaotic, Trump-led, loser party in 2024.

Thiel was a major donor to Trump's campaign in 2016, chipping in $1.25 million dollars, but now looks back on his investment with regret.

“There are a lot of things I got wrong,” Thiel said. “It was crazier than I thought. It was more dangerous than I thought. They couldn’t get the most basic pieces of the government to work. So that was—I think that part was maybe worse than even my low expectations.”

The tech billionaire was further convinced against supporting Trump after hearing the former disgraced President called him a “f---ing scumbag” when Thiel refused Trump's request for a $10 million dollar donation.

It's readily apparent that Trump is an anchor around the neck of the GOP, and his losing brand is dragging them all the way down."
"Most Democrats I know believe that, if one of our politicians is guilty of a crime (let alone multiple crimes) we are the first to call them out and publicly insist that they resign and be held accountable.

Republicans, however, will deny that there was any crime, and then say if there was a crime, it wasn't illegal, but even if it was illegal it doesn't matter because look at what other people did.

We are not the same."

"Volvo's motto is ""Volvo, for Life,"" but their heavy duty vehicle engines are contributing to pollution conditions called Diesel Death Zones.

Transportation stands out as one of the few sectors where pollution is on the rise, and 70% of the cancer risk from air pollution comes from diesel trucks which use the engines produced by @VolvoTrucksNA and @DaimlerTruckNA.

Those companies made a commitment to have undertaken major pledges to cut their emissions in alignment with their environmental and health-oriented goals, but they're trying to back out by lobbying the EPA for weaker standards. 

It's sickening to know these filthy-rich corporations are wheeling and dealing behind closed doors to keep the standards on their engines as weak and deadly to the rest of us as they can get away with.

Here's how we STOP them from doing it:"
"🚨🚨NEWS: In a major development, Michigan's Attorney General Heather Meingast made it clear to a judge that both she and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ""stand ready"" to bar Trump from the 2024 ballot due to his role in inciting the January 6 insurrection. 

Meingast emphasized the Secretary's commitment to upholding the state's election laws and preserving the integrity of the electoral process. 

The Attorney General stated, “To be clear, the Secretary of State stands ready to comply with whatever order this court issues in relation to the former president's eligibility to appear on the ballot.""

This forthright stance from the Secretary of State is a blow to Trump, indicating a decisive move against him despite attempts to maintain public neutrality. 

Meingast's assertion that the Secretary ""stands ready"" signals thorough preparations to hold Trump accountable for his alleged role in inciting the insurrection aimed at overturning Biden's victory.

The Michigan Attorney General reiterated the gravity of the Secretary's duty, stating, ""Your Honor, the Secretary takes her role as the state's Chief Elections Officer very seriously."" 

The assurance to comply with the court's order underscores the state's commitment to fair and lawful elections, implying a potential ban on Trump's ballot appearance.

The news compounds Trump's challenges as the judge, having heard incriminating evidence against him, announced her readiness to deliver a ruling on his eligibility for the ballot in the ""next few days."""

In fact, many of them are completely anonymous.

In Dallas, Texas, residents of an apartment complex are exemplifying the true spirit of community by setting up a unique initiative to ensure everyone has enough to eat. 

Renee, a young woman residing in the complex, took to social media to share the heartwarming discovery she made in her building.

“My apartment complex has a community pantry where we (residents) drop things we don’t need for those who may need it – check this out,” Renee shared in her online post. 

The community pantry serves as a centralized location within the complex where residents can contribute any surplus food items, fostering a sense of shared responsibility.

This thoughtful gesture goes beyond just canned goods, as the pantry includes a refrigerator stocked with extra cooked meals. The community's commitment extends to their furry friends, with a dedicated shelf for sharing additional dog and cat food and treats. 

Renee expressed her appreciation, noting, “There’s a whole fridge too :-)” It's a comprehensive effort to address not only human needs but also those of pets within the community.

Renee emphasized the profound impact of this act of kindness, stating, “It warms my heart because you never know who may be in need.” 

The initiative reflects a genuine sense of compassion and community support, highlighting the power of neighbors coming together to ensure the well-being of all residents, especially during challenging times.

"🚨UNBELIEVABLE HYPOCRISY: In an incredible revelation, prominent Trump apologist Rep James Comer, Chairman of the influential House Oversight Committee, faces embarrassing exposure for engaging in the very ""shady business practices"" he vehemently accused Joe Biden of. 

The irony is staggering, as Comer received a $200,000 repayment from his brother, mirroring the transactions he condemned in Biden's case.

Comer, known for relentlessly attacking Biden over allegedly ""troubling"" dealings with his brother, conducted similar transactions while in a position of power overseeing agricultural policy. 

Unlike Biden, who engaged in these transactions as a private citizen, Comer's actions occurred while he held a significant official role.

The $200,000 routed through a dubious shell company raises questions about Comer's financial dealings. Land swaps and requests for favorable tax treatment further compound the controversy. 

During these transactions, Comer, a member of the House Agricultural Committee shaping farm policy and authorizing federal programs, maintained ownership of a family farm, presenting a glaring conflict of interest.

Delaney Marsco, senior ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Centre, highlights the potential exploitation of political power for personal gain, suggesting that Comer may have sought to ""game a personal business advantage."" 

Marsco emphasizes the importance of transparency, stating that voters deserve assurance that lawmakers prioritize the public interest over personal business advantages in their legislative roles. 

Comer has some serious explaining to do."

That person doesn’t exist. I don’t play politics when it comes to force mass-poisoning children so they can attend school."

Trying to make me out to be “pro big pharma” is never going to stick. 

You’ll try it anyway, because you have nothing left in the Desantis arsenal."
"Lmao. You sound so desperate. I am proudly and passionately against vaccines. I have never altered my stance, and I spoke candidly with Vivek about that public. 

Vivek, Trump & Desantis are all pro- medical choice.

I will never waver from my stance on vaccines and I think RFK has done amazing work exposing its evils."

I couldn’t resist but to ask the owner his opinion about his purchase 

Unbeknownst to me it was only two weeks old 
So he was a lot more enthusiastic about his Tesla than I expected and kindly offered for me to have a look and sit in the drivers seat to get a feel of the car

I was very impressed with the quality finish of the interior and the feel of the steering and comfort of the seats

I have coveted the Tesla for a while now

"A lot of truth to this but you’re missing a piece. There is some real creative talent on the Right. I’ve worked with some of them. But the other part of the problem is that when conservatives try to do anything creative, and especially if they have any kind of success, there will always be others on the Right who look for a reason to tear them down and insist that what they’ve done is actually somehow bad for some dumb reason or another. 

Conservatives are generally really bad at supporting their own creative talent. Leftists have a united front while we eat each other alive for no apparent reason. If you want conservatives to create culture then you need to find your talented culture creators and support them. Instead we get stuck in these purity spirals and nothing is ever good enough"

"On NEVER TRUMP. If you were around in 2015-2016, you remember the “conservative movement” to stop Trump. They attacked him. Said he couldn’t win. After Access Hollywood, they said QUIT THE RACE. They wanted to give the country to Hillary. 

Trump won, now what? You can’t be a viable PERSONALITY if you opposed Trump. Listeners won’t listen or buy books. Never Trump’ers got in line. They SAW THE LIGHT. They LOVE Trump. 

Lmfao! It’s was obviously fake. But as usual, conservatives can be goobers and they fall for it. “People change,” audiences said. They opened their wallets up to the same people ready to cut and run over one Trump audio clip.

It’s 2023 and the familiar arguments surface. Trump can’t win! We will be giving the country to Democrats! 

Now that Never Trump have their stalking horse in DeSantis, they are all suddenly turning on Trump. This time with more delicacy. They won’t say they hate Trump. That would be PERSONALITY suicide. It’s a tightrope. 

When the country was about to be destroyed, some held and line and some didn’t. They showed up after victory to claim credit or at least blend in. 

That’s the true story of the Never Trump movement - then and rebranded for the 2024 election."

How did she repay him?

By endorsing his opponent, another disloyal governor who took Trump’s endorsement only to backstab him a few years later

The 1 silver lining here is that we now know who’s who

No more hiding"
"One year from today @realDonaldTrump will evict Crooked Joe from our beautiful White House!"
"Trump 2024!!"

"DeSantis’ “special helper” Bryan Griffin and his sidekick, Christina “Botched” Pushaw spend all day every day attacking Trump and his supporters like @LauraLoomer online using their own accounts or their burner accounts.

But when confronted in person they had nothing to say… Keyboard clowns."
"Trump is the only electable Republican in 2024. I want to win. That’s why I support Trump. MAGA!"
"Everything about DeSanctus is fake!"
"LMAO, did Vivek Ramaswamy just say having Greg Gutfield as a moderator is how you get your country back?

What a mouthy clown."
"In the aftermath of Tuesday's big wins for Democrats, the GOP thinks they lost because folks were allowed to vote. Americans voted against awful anti-abortion policies the majority of voters reject.

Republicans will keep losing if they keep trying to control women's bodies."
"I remain baffled that seditious Ginni Thomas still has yet to be subpoenaed.

What's that all about?"
"NEWS: trump just said he'd consider Tucker Carlson as his running mate if (when) he gets the nomination.

Is he serious, or is he desperate?
And would that worry you?"
"Katy Tur is up there right now begging Symone Sanders to say that Democrats don't really want President Biden to run for reelection.

She is the awful Andrea Mitchell-in-training.
So sick of her bullshit."
"🚨MORE EXCELLENT NEWS: In a night full of MAGA losses, perhaps no other group suffered more losses than Moms for Liberty, the controversial pro-Trump group, which faced resounding defeats in five out of the six states where their candidates contested. 

They were absolutely clobbered in Pennsylvania, where all five of their candidates, running on a platform of banning educational books related to slavery and LGBTQ+ inclusion, were decisively beaten by Democratic contenders.

Virginia witnessed an even more significant defeat, with three Moms for Liberty school board candidates losing by substantial margins. 

Iowa saw a staggering nine Moms for Liberty candidates losing their races after accusing local school districts of ""disseminating pornography to children"" for featuring books discussing LGBTQ+ acceptance.

Meanwhile, in Minnesota, all four Moms for Liberty candidates were overwhelmed by their Democratic opponents. North Carolina also experienced a setback as their sole candidate suffered a decisive defeat.

These results highlight the voters' rejection of Moms for Liberty values and raise questions about the popularity of their positions, particularly those related to educational materials and LGBTQ+ issues. 

And it's even more likely that voters are starting to signal their fatigue with Trump-aligned candidates."
"Andrea Mitchell is the worst.
MSNBC needs to move on. 

Change my mind."
"THANK YOU to the Grassroots VIPs — our Volunteers In Politics from SF to OH to VA — who helped Democrats deliver Democracy on Election Day 2023!  Months of phone and text banks, door knocks, picket lines and coalition work helped make the difference.

When we VOTE, we WIN! -NP"
"While I'll admit it is super fun to spike the damn football (and I will be doing it some more today), we can't rest on this victory; we have to BUILD on it. Let's use the momentum from these wins to propel us into 2024 with enthusiasm about all the things DEMs do for America."

"🇺🇲Election Night lesson:

When we show up, we win. 💙

- Democratic Governor Andy Beshear wins reelection

- Ohioans voted to protect Women's access to abortion.

- Governor Glenn Youngkin can go cry into his fascist vest for the next two years, he didn't get the Virginia Senate he needed to pass his 15 week abortion ban.

These are not insignificant wins.

These are HUGE wins, with major ramifications for next year. 

Republicans have delivered the worst possible issue to defend against, and we'll ride it to victory with all of the legislative successes of the Democratic party in 2024.

And all we have to do is show up."

"Casey DeSantis used teleprompters during her intro screech of Rob DeSantis.

The first thing Rob did when he got on stage was attack her for using teleprompters.

Who attacks their own wife like that?! So strange!!!"

"DeSantis “influencers” are already beginning to boost RFK Jr against Trump. They will kick it into the next gear once DeSantis drops out."

DeSantis doesn’t care about winning in 2024, all he and his donors want to do is sabotage Trump.

Fortunately, DeSantis’ “influencers” have proven to be not influential whatsoever.

Trump 2024."

""Dear stranger next to us at the rodeo,

When my son came up to you and grabbed your arm, you didn't know he used to be terrified of people. When he talked to you about the bulls, you didn't know he was diagnosed with a language disorder. 

When he jumped in your lap and laughed as you tickled him, you didn't know he had a sensory processing disorder. You also didn't know as his mother, I sat in my seat, with tears running down my face, sneaking this photo. 

When we adopted him a few short months ago, we didn't know how long it would take for him to laugh, play and engage others like this. You didn't know any of this, but you took time to connect with a child who has had to fight to learn to connect. 

My heart is full. Thank you.""

"IT’S ELECTION DAY!

Make your voice heard, and stand up for those who can’t stand up for themselves. Go vote! 

And if abortion rights are on the ballot in your state - show up as an ally and vote to protect access!"
"They don't legislate men's bodies.

They don't force vasectomies.
They don't tax Viagra, or ban it.
They don't criminalize spilled semen.

But what about Women?

- Forced to carry their rapists babies, even if they're as young as twelve years old.

- Denied access to abortions, even in the instance where it could save her life.

- Can be reported by ""private citizens"" for seeking abortion care in exchange for $10K reward in Texas.

- NOT allowed to make her own decisions on family planning without input from Republican politicians.

REMEMBER that when you vote.
VOTE BLUE."
"Karma comes to collect: Rudy Giuliani's financial woes continue to mount, as reports now suggest that the disgraced former ""America's Mayor"" faces the possible foreclosure of his Palm Beach condo due to unpaid taxes. 

The Palm Beach Post has disclosed that Giuliani's failure to meet property tax obligations could lead to the loss of his beachfront residence. The outstanding tax debt exceeds $84,000, and a firm has already secured the tax sale certificates, paving the way for a potential foreclosure in the spring of 2024.

Giuliani's financial struggles are further exacerbated by mounting legal fees stemming from various lawsuits and indictments related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Some of his attorneys have already resigned due to non-payment.

This property tax predicament is just one of Giuliani's ongoing financial issues. He also grapples with $500,000 in unpaid federal taxes, as reported by Forbes. The IRS has additionally placed a lien on his Palm Beach condo. 

Giuliani faces a $236,000 debt in a defamation case following his fabrication of a story about election workers in Georgia. 

It's noteworthy that many of his issues are due to his support of Trump, who has ironically declined to cover Giuliani's legal fees."

"If you're determined to keep fighting for women's rights to bodily autonomy, then I suggest you follow us at @ReallyAmerican1 where we are focused on defeating Republicans who believe that legislators, not women, should be responsible for decisions about their own bodies."
"NEW: Jack Smith just filed court documents that could be damning to Trump's claims about January 6th

Responding to a motion filed by former President Trump's legal team, federal prosecutors on Monday argued allegations related to the events at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 are 'relevant and probative' in the Washington, DC case against the former president.

The Prosecutors allege that Trump ‘Is Responsible for the Events at the Capitol on January 6’

Trump is charged with four federal felonies in the case alleging he obstructed the 2020 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Trump's legal team had argued in their motion that because none of the four felony counts in the case directly charge the former president with responsibility for the actions at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, ""allegations related to these actions are not relevant and are prejudicial and inflammatory"" and should be stricken from the indictment.

In their response filed on Monday, prosecutors countered by arguing that Trump is, in fact, responsible for those events.

His trial is scheduled to begin on March 4."
"Good morning and Happy Tuesday to everyone who has early voted, who's voting, or spreading the word about our CRITICAL elections today in Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, and elsewhere -- states where a woman's right to choose is at stake.🚨

"VIRGINIA: You MUST vote Blue today if you care about protecting Women's bodily autonomy.

Glenn Youngkin has already vowed to pass a 15-week abortion ban, and he purged a bunch of Democratic voters to help make it happen.

DON'T LET HIM WIN.

"Today was the first time in a long time that I've ever been grateful for the 2nd Amendment, because we got to watch trump shoot himself in the foot all day long."
"Let's talk about trump's LONG string of broken promises.

He promised to build a wall.
He only did 458 miles out of 2,000.
Much of it was replacement, not new.

He promised to make Mexico pay.
They didn't.

He promised to cut the deficit.
He added $8T to it.

He promised to unveil a new health care plan.
It didn't exist.

He promised a middle class tax cut.
He cut taxes for the rich.
The middle class is paying for it.

He said COVID would just go away like magic.
Hocus Pocus: it didn't.

He said he wouldn't play golf as President.
He made 250 visit to his own golf clubs.
It cost taxpayers $136 million.

He said he'd increase economic growth by 4%.
He didn't. President Biden did.
And trump is the first President to LOSE
millions of jobs since Herbert Hoover.

He promised an infrastructure plan.
He had none. 
President Biden signed a massive one.

He promised to hire ""the best people.""
He fired half of them, and then said they
were the worst ever. 

He promised to bring down the price of prescription drugs.
He didn't: President Biden did.

He promised to drain the swamp.
He didn't: He WAS the swamp.

He promised to make America Great Again.
He didn't. If he did, it'd still be great.
But he's campaigning on the same thing.

This was only a partial list of broken promises.

trump is saying all over again that he'll do all of the things he promised to do but never did because he was too busy with petty beefs and breaking the law.

Enough with the broken promises.

President Biden and Democrats DELIVER."

The lawyer then asks if Trump can see that it says ""in order to induce lending,"" and Trump again says ""yes.""

"Sometimes, acts of kindness from strangers can save lives. Even a 16-year-old stranger. 💙

A compassionate young man spotted a stranger sitting on a bridge ledge in Dublin, Ireland, engaged in a 45-minute conversation, and saved his life. 🙏

""I was just on my way to the American sweet shop to buy some Gatorade, when I saw this guy in his 30s sitting on the ledge of the bridge. I just thought, ""wow..."" I stopped and asked him if he was okay, but I knew from the look in his eyes he wasn't, and he didn't say anything either, but I saw tears coming from his eyes. 

I pleaded with him for a while to come down and sit on the steps, and eventually he did. We sat on the sidewalk on the south side of the Liffey and talked for about 45 minutes, about what was happening to him, why was he feeling that way... 

I couldn't leave him there alone, but I had to go, so I was going to ring an ambulance. I told him they could help him feel better. But he was like ""please, please don't call them, I'm fine, I just want to walk around for a while, I'm gonna be okay!"" 

I  told him to please let me ring an ambulance, that I wouldn't sleep knowing he was just walking around alone. So I rang it, and he was taken to St. James Hospital. I got his number so I would know what was going on with him for a good while... 

And about three months ago, he texted me that his wife is pregnant, they're having a boy, and they're naming him after me. Can you believe that? They're going to name their child after me... 

He said in that moment that I approached him, he was just about to jump, and those few words saved his life. That they're still ringing in his head every day. ""Are you okay?"" 

I can't really understand how these few words could save his life, but he told me, ""Imagine if nobody ever asked you those words..."" ""

"🚨🚨BREAKING: Disgraced former President Donald Trump is turning in a disgraceful performance during his testimony in a New York courtroom today, now having been admonished numerous times by Judge Engoron for not answering questions.

Trump has been refusing to answer direct questions from the prosecution, choosing instead to lash out at the judge, the prosecution, and the Democratic party, painting himself as a victim of political targeting.

At one point, Trump complained about Engoron, saying, ""I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me."" 

But the judge is not entertaining Trump's overly-dramatic answers. He reportedly told Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, ""Mr. Kise - can you control your client? This is not a political rally . . . maybe you should have a talk with him right now.""

It should be noted that Judge Engoron has already ruled Trump is liable for fraud, and these proceedings are merely to determine how much the Trumps will have to pay in damages."
"Donald trump is refusing to answer direct questions in court now, instead choosing to speechify about how he believes he's being targeted.

"I've seen creepy stuff before, but all the way near the top of the list is Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson putting software on his son's devices, and his own, so they can be ""accountability partners"" and monitor each other's online porn habits.

Ewww."
"Whomever made this, bravo!"
"Let's talk about WHY House Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson's idea to release 40,000 hours of House CCTV from January 6th ONLY to ultra-right wing ""news"" outlet The Blaze is such a horrendously horrible idea.

First, let's establish what has ALREADY transpired:

All of us watched and experienced, in real time, footage from the events of January 6th, as they unfolded.

This includes dozens of trump's high-level supporters, people ""on the inside"" who frantically tried to reach Mark Meadows ON THAT DAY, begging him to put out a statement to stop his supporters from rioting.

From Laura Ingraham to Mark Meadows: 
Hey Mark, The president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us

He is destroying his legacy and playing into every stereotype … we lose all credibility against the BLM/Antifa crowd if things go South

Rep. Barry Loudermilk to Mark Meadows
It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol.  We are under siege in the capitol

Donald Trump Jr. to Mark Meadows
He’s got to condemn this shit. Asap. The capitol police tweet is not enough. 

This his one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.

Why did people, including his own unhinged son, panic upon seeing the same things we did? Does that sound like a normal, peaceful tour to anyone? 

Not at all. They were rightfully sickened and fearful by the violent images we saw, that Tucker Carlson would later try to gaslight us into thinking we didn't actually see.

In fact, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy even admitted trump's culpability in the dangerous fiasco, saying on the House floor. “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.""

He said this, of course, before releasing tons of footage to Tucker Carlson, and ONLY Tucker.

TUCKER CARLSON'S SELECTIVE EDITING
Weakest Speaker in the history of House, McCarthy agreed to release 41,000 hours of January 6th footage to far-right wing promoter of “Great Replacement” theory Tucker Carlson.  

Out of 41,000 hours of footage that would have included video of January 6th Capitol attackers smearing the walls with feces and smashing Capitol Police officers with fire extinguishers, Carlson cherry-picked a few out-of-context videos showing calm images of people being led through the Capitol, pushing the narrative that ""nothing happened.""

Sure, you could edit footage of the Diamondbacks scoring runs and show the Texas Rangers' hitters striking out to make it look like Arizona won the whole thing, but everyone who watched (and laughed and cried) would know it was false.

WHO IS MAGA MIKE JOHNSON?
Mike Johnson played a key role in the efforts by trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Specifically, he led the amicus brief in support of a Texas lawsuit trying to invalidate the 2020 election results in four swing states Biden won: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

So naturally, anything that would potentially tell a different story of January 6th, rather than the one correctly painting him as a leading member of the Sedition Caucus, is welcomed by the new House Speaker.

WHAT IS The Blaze?
The Blaze is an ultra right wing conservative ""news"" outlet, founded by Glenn Beck. Beck, who believes that ""shadowy elites have taken over the country,"" also believes that Tucker Carlson's selectively-edited clips from January 6th are proof that the January 6th committee lied about the events of that day.

So would it surprise anyone if the footage selected from that day helps to support Beck's belief? I wouldn't be surprised at all.

SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
So OK, let's play devil's advocate for a moment and ask the question ""What's the big deal? Who cares if The Blaze tries to paint a picture that the Diamondbacks actually WON the World Series, and that January 6th was a calm, ordinary tour of the Capitol? Who even watches or reads The Blaze anyway?""

Plenty of people. And since it is now guaranteed to be given favorable treatment under Twitter's new pro-right algorithm, the views of the cherry-picked footage will go through the roof, and then be picked up by Fox and Newsmax which, unfortunately, ARE watched by millions.

As a nation, we're still struggling to get back to a junction where we can all collectively agree that 2+2 DOES equal 4, and it's not a plot by elite coastal libs to make it seem that way. And dumping thousands of hours of footage onto ONE SIDE are not helpful.

I will admit that, throughout the many hours of footage, there are probably pockets of video that show people calmly walking from one section of the building to another. No argument there.

And I will also admit that, in every crowd of rampaging angry rioters, that there are handfuls of people just milling about, taking pictures, not hurting anyone. But that makes them the exception to the rule, it doesn't characterize the entire mob that way.

Release the footage to Reuters and Associated Press, which are generally seen as closer to the middle.

Release the footage publicly, to everyone, and let us draw our own conclusions.

But to first slide it over to Tucker Carlson, and now to The Blaze, makes it painfully obvious that these complicit MAGA House Speakers are trying to craft a bullshit narrative to cover their own asses.

And it needs to be called out. LOUDLY."

This decision followed a massive influx of hundreds of threats of violence received by the court due to Trump's attacks on Engoron, state prosecutors, and the court clerk.

Trump has been fined $15,000 for violating the gag order twice, with both instances involving the judge's clerk, whom the former president labeled as ""partisan."" 

On the second occasion, Trump attempted to assert that his remarks were aimed at his former attorney, Michael Cohen, who was a witness in the trial. Engoron dismissed this explanation.

In response to another comment made by Trump's attorney, Christopher Keiss, Engoron hinted at the possibility of extending the ban to cover attorneys.

It is disgraceful that a former President lacks the impulse control to refrain from threatening citizens and members of the court, and lacks the ability to prevent his lawyers from doing the same.

At some point, jail time might be necessary to send Trump and his legal team a clear message."

"🚨This story is AMAZING.

Real heroes don't wear capes:
Sometimes they wear webs.

A real-life hero is making a difference on the streets of Birmingham. Disguised as Spider-Man, this 20-year-old, who prefers to remain anonymous, purchases food and sandwiches from stores to distribute to the homeless in his community.

""I've worked with homeless and vulnerable people for three or four years and love seeing the smiles on people's faces,"" he explained. ""Then I thought, 'if they are happy now, imagine how much bigger the smile would be if it was Spider-Man giving out the food.'""

Several nights a week, between 9 pm and midnight, he dons his superhero costume and seeks out those who are hungry, cold, and sleeping rough.

""I've learned that everyone is the same; we're all part of the human experience, and I believe that we need to look at everyone as humans and help each other the same as we would a close friend,"" said the compassionate Spider-Man.

His actions not only bring joy to the homeless but also aim to inspire others to become heroes for those in need.

""Before, when I was handing out food, no one would take a second look,"" he noted. ""But when they see Spider-Man handing out the food, they come over and ask what I'm doing and are really interested. Most importantly, they become inspired to get involved themselves.""

News of the Spider-Man of Birmingham spread globally, prompting people to fundraise and donate to his cause. But he declines their donations and instead encourages them to go out into their own communities and assist the less fortunate.

""People have seen me on Facebook or Twitter, and they say what I am doing is really good. Some are even saying they want to do the same. I plan to do it for as long as I can.""

He is also dedicated to raising awareness about homelessness and educating others on the importance of helping one another."

"Oh this is hilarious:

If you're in a courtroom as an attorney, and you mention Breitbart dot com as a credible source of information, you might want to consider trading in your law degree for a comedian's microphone.

Donald Trump's attorney expressed concerns about a mistrial in the $250 million fraud case, citing the right-wing media website's accusation of bias against a New York City law clerk. 

Chris Kise referenced a Breitbart report as the source of his concern, and the courtroom burst into laughter.

""I think the defense will have to give serious consideration to seeking a mistrial,"" Kise stated during the Friday morning proceedings, as reported by ABC News.

In response, Judge Engoron characterized the report as an ""allegation"" rather than substantive information, emphasizing that it pertained to a ""random individual"" with ""accusations of partisan political activity.""

An attorney from Attorney General Letitia James's office questioned the seriousness of Kise's claims, particularly since he couldn't immediately recall the website responsible for the report. Kise defended himself, saying, ""I'm not the internet person. I want to say it is on Breitbart, maybe? It's on a news outlet.""

This reference to Breitbart triggered laughter from onlookers, as reported by ABC News."

"🚨🚨GOP IN DISARRAY, Space Laser Edition:

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is locked in yet another heated exchange with fellow Republican Lauren Boebert, ripping her for her notorious Beetlejuice sexual misconduct scandal.

The clash began when Greene faced resistance from some within the Republican caucus over her motion to censure Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, which was criticized by Republican Representative Chip Roy. 

He described Greene's resolution as ""flawed"" and filled with ""unverified claims,"" including allegations of leading an 'insurrection.'

This criticism triggered a fiery response from Greene, who took to Twitter to air her frustration. She accused her fellow Republicans of retaining figures like Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert, whom she referred to as a ""vaping groper,"" while voting with Democrats to protect Representative Tlaib. 

Greene also accused them of disliking former President Trump, acknowledging President Biden's election, and showing indifference towards the prosecution of January 6 defendants.

Rep. Roy lashed back, ridiculing Greene's conspiracy theories, suggesting that she should chase after ""Jewish space lasers"" if she wanted to focus on such matters. 

Greene shot back, calling him ""Colonel Sanders"" and insinuating that he had little to do with Texas, and slamming him as a career politician.

A short while ago, Greene ironically called for ""decorum"" in the House, even though she is known for being disruptive and inappropriate. 

Her inflammatory insults directed at Boebert were written on her official government account.

Once again, while the country faces unique challenges, Republicans are focused on petty matters instead of legislating for Americans."

“Tell her to go chase so-called Jewish space lasers if she wants to spend time on that sort of thing,”

🔥🔥🔥

Marjorie Taylor Greene attacked the Republican in a series of tweets that accused Roy of siding with Democrats. 

“You hate Trump, certified Biden’s election, and could care less about J6 defendants being persecuted,” she wrote. 

She also accused Roy of voting to kick her out of the Freedom Caucus but allowing “vaping groping” Rep. Lauren Boebert” to stay.

"But who is this American woman? How did she meet the Tate brothers? Who are the 3 other alleged victims named in Andrew’s case and what do they have to say about it? If you do not know these answers and yet have assisted the media in its character assassination of the Tate brothers since their arrest, then you are abetting a trial by media rather than a trial by fact."
"Given the noise of social media, many are unaware, but Andrew and Tristan Tate’s current case in Romania began after a young American woman from the Palm Beach area booked herself a business class, one-way ticket to Romania using Tristan’s credit card. Just six days later (and despite her pleas for the efforts to be reversed) the United States embassy was contacted and Romanian authorities swooped in to rescue her from an alleged human trafficking situation."
"Of course, these utterly baseless attacks against me only worked to further my interest in his case. And when I dug further, I was shocked at what I discovered…"
"Over the last week, I have faced everything from absurd libels (aiding a human trafficker and pornographer) to wild conspiracies (Tate must have paid her, or must be blackmailing her), simply for refusing to join the chorus of individuals who wish to convict @Cobratate on the basis of whether or not they believe him to be a good or bad person."
"In fact so deeply embedded is our presumption of guilt for men, that should any person have the gall to question an alleged victim—the media (mainstream, alternative, AND independent) then works to smear and libel that individual. 

Somehow, I have always had the gall."
"But objective immorality, whether past or present does not make somebody guilty of a crime. 

Since the era of #metoo, it has become customary for women to be immediately believed and subsequently afforded protection by the media. While men who face allegations have every area of their lives painfully examined, the women behind these allegations are not subjected to the same inspection."
"🚨🧵In a few hours, I will be dropping an explosive video regarding the #AndrewTate case.

We live in a modern society that has fostered a fundamental hatred for men and it is much easier to hate men that come from a checkered past and who have said and done things that we deem to be immoral."

"In the contest for the worst U.S. politician, Trump wins easily. Right behind him is the sedition caucus consisting of coward Josh Hawley, military obstructionist Tommy Tuberville, and a clown car full of criminal co-conspirators.

The GOP does not have the decency to lead."
"The prospect of a 2nd Trump term and a Republican sweep of Congress is VERY real

Another Trump win would sound the death knell for our democracy

We must work shoulder to shoulder to prevent this

As Wisconsin goes, so goes the nation

Help us sound the alarm now 🚨"
"Heartbreaking: Lindsey Graham, one of the worst Senators you know, just made a great point about Tommy Tuberville.
twitter.com/Acyn/status/1719…"
"JUST IN: The Republican party is still predictably crooked, failing to expel their very worst sitting Congressman, Rep. George Santos.

The vote was 213 to 179, with 19 voting present.

Use it against them in 2024, folks."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: The House is expected to vote on whether to expel Rep. George Santos sometime after 6:30 pm ET tonight, as per Democratic whip Katherine Clark’s office.

To make matters even worse for Santos, five House Republican lawmakers from New York have sent a letter, strongly imploring that he be expelled.

“As Republican Members from the New York Delegation, we fully support Santos’ expulsion, and ask all of our colleagues to join us in voting yes,” the letter begins, which was signed by GOP members Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Anthony D’Esposito, Marcus Molinaro and Brandon Williams. 

The letter even dismisses Republican concerns that Santos' expulsion could put their slim House majority in jeopardy. 

""The United States Congress must always uphold the highest standards and ensure accountability for those who have taken advantage of the American people – regardless of political party.”

The ethics committee has also announced it will provide an update about its investigation into Santos by November 17th, while some House members are concerned that removing him from his seat before he is convicted will set a bad precedent."
"HOLY SH*T: As just reported by Ali Vitale on MSNBC, a small group of Republican Senators are ready to cross the aisle to vote with DEMOCRATS to break Tommy Tuberville's stupid military blockade.

WOW!"
"On second thought...

The cop was holding up 3 fingers in the video, which yeah, it could have meant 3 percenter, but it could have meant something entirely different.

And I couldn't say with 100% certainty.
So I took it down.

In case this cop was innocently telling them to go to room 300, or signaling that 3 people were entering, I'd rather not be instrumental in causing a guy to lose his job and his ability to support his family.

I saw something that looked questionable, and I reacted to it without thinking, and that was wrong.

I try my hardest NOT to contribute to the stream of misinformation on this site, and when I catch myself I'll be sure to delete and let you folks know.

Thanks for riding with me.🙏💪"

"This is an AMAZING story💙: a successful Canadian entrepreneur is building 99 tiny homes to cut homelessness in his community – he even provides jobs for them on site!

Marcel LeBrun, the founder of 12 Neighbors, sold his thriving social media monitoring company for eight figures to a U.S. competitor. He has now committed his substantial profit to addressing homelessness in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

12 Neighbors, located in Fredericton, is a community development initiative focused on creating a gated community of 99 tiny homes and an enterprise center, providing homeless individuals in Fredericton with a chance for a fresh start. 

The project is designed to support those in need by offering shelter, employment, and a sense of belonging.

LeBrun has invested $4 million of his own money into the project, which is already three-quarters complete. In addition to his personal investment, 12 Neighbors has received support from provincial and national governments, totaling $12 million. 

The tiny homes are fully equipped, featuring a complete kitchen, living and sleeping areas, and a full bathroom. Each home is equipped with solar panels on the roof and decorated with an aesthetically pleasing coat of paint.

LeBrun believes that tackling homelessness can be more straightforward than perceived, and providing a tiny home can be a pivotal step in the right direction.

“I see myself as a community builder, and really what we’re doing here is not just building a little community, but we’re building a community in a city, like how do we help our city be better?” LeBrun said.

The community also includes an enterprise center, which will feature a resident-run coffee bar, a ""teaching kitchen,"" and a silk-screening business. 

These elements are intended to make 12 Neighbors a place where the wider Fredericton community can visit for coffee or take advantage of affordable printing services.

Marcel LeBrun's project exemplifies the transformative impact that wealth, creativity, and compassion can have on the lives of those experiencing homelessness."
"If the New Yorkers in Santos' district had known about the outrageous mountain of lies Santos told, they would not have voted for him. In fact, 78% of his constituents said in a poll that he should resign, including 89% of Democrats, 72% of independents and 71% of Republicans."
"If you're hopeful that the House of Representatives will soon return to some semblance of normalcy by at least removing its most egregiously deceitful member, the I suggest you follow us at @ReallyAmerican1, where we believe voters have a right to know who they are electing."
"JUST IN: Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy, and torpedoed both Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan's Speaker hopes, just announced that he will NOT seek reelection at the end of his term.

It's the second such announcement from Republican members of Congress today.

I hope it's a trend."
"Josh Hawley is making a solid argument here for his own removal, as well as other lying Republicans:

""When you systematically mislead the American people and lie and lie and lie to the American people. You're not doing your job and you should be removed."""
"BREAKING: According to reports, $2.99/gallon is the most commonly seen gas price in the United States. Reports also indicate that 38,000 stations, or 25% of the entire nation's gas stations have a price of $2.99/gallon price or better. This is a big deal."

"Follow the MAGA Mike Money: New GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson began his tenure in a swirl of controversy about his positions on abortion and same sex marriage, but a bizarre new fact has come to light: he does not appear to have a bank account in his name.

This should be a MUCH bigger story.

According to a report from The Daily Beast's Roger Sollenberger, ""Over the course of seven years, Johnson has never reported a checking or savings account in his name, nor in the name of his wife or any of his children, disclosures show. 

In fact, he doesn’t appear to have money stashed in any investments, with his latest filing — covering 2022 — showing no assets whatsoever.""

Reporting guidelines for the House Ethics Committee mandate the disclosure of any bank accounts that have at least $1,000 with the combination of ALL accounts, including family members and children, exceeding $5,000. 

The absence of a bank account, while Johnson draws a $174,000 annual salary plus an additional $30,000 from teaching, is extremely suspicious.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) communications director Jordan Libowitz noted “He made over $200,000 last year, and his wife took home salary from two employers as well, so why isn’t there a bank account or any form of savings listed?” 

Libowitz added that if Johnson's lack of a bank account is an accurate reflection of his financial situation, it leaves him susceptible to possible financial corruption or manipulation."

"🚨🚨NEWS: A prominent Senate Democrat has leveled a serious accusation against Senator Tommy Tuberville, alleging his actions may have contributed to General Eric Smith's recent cardiac emergency. 

Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed blames Tuberville for blocking military promotions to pressure the Pentagon into changing abortion policies, leading to overworked military officers.

Tuberville's political maneuver has compelled officers to handle multiple roles, pushing some to exhaustion. General Smith's hospitalization, likely due to overwork, has been characterized as an apparent heart attack and is a stark example of the consequences. 

Senator Reed highlighted the dangers of Tuberville's anti-abortion tactics, emphasizing the need for a more rational approach.

This situation raises concerns about Tuberville prioritizing far-right religious voters over national security, potentially jeopardizing the military to gain favor with religious interest groups. 

The fallout from his actions should have severe consequences for his political career as it adversely impacts the military's operational efficiency."

"🚨MAGA Mike Johnson's religious litmus tests: 

Fresh perspective into the beliefs of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) are coming to the surface, shedding light on how his fundamentalist Christian values may impact his political actions. 

According to a recent report by David Corn, DC bureau chief of Mother Jones, Johnson and his wife, Kelly, once conducted seminars promoting the unfounded idea of the United States being a ""Christian nation."" 

These seminars, ranging from two-hour lectures to multi-day retreats, encouraged participants to assess the suitability of public office candidates based on their willingness to merge religion and politics.

In a video from 2019, Kelly Johnson purportedly conveyed that ""biblical Christianity,"" involving a literal interpretation of the Bible, including the belief that the Earth is merely 6,000 years old, was the sole valid worldview. 

Mike Johnson was quoted in the same video stating, ""You better sit down any candidate who says they're going to run for the legislature and say, 'I want to know what your worldview is. 

I want to know what you think about the Christian heritage of this country. I want to know what you think about God’s design for society. Have you even thought about that?' If they haven’t thought about it, you need to move on and find somebody who has.""

Commenting on the video, David Corn highlighted that while Mike Johnson recommended anyone interested in his beliefs to ""go pick up a Bible,"" his suggestion to subject public officials to a religious litmus test implied his support for a form of ""theocracy."" 

These stated beliefs are hard-baked into Johnson, and won't be discarded just because he has a position of high authority. 

There is a very real growing concern that his ""Christian"" beliefs could be used to disenfranchise those who do not share his faith."

"🚨CONGRESSMAN HARRY DUNN? Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, having already defended our Capitol against January 6th insurrectionists, may be looking to serve the American people from the inside of the House chamber.

Dunn is eyeing a possible run for the House of Representatives.

When it was announced that Rep. John Sarbanes (D-MD) was not going to be running for a 10th term, Dunn shared a news article about it on social media and commented ""I see there is going to be an open Congressional seat in Maryland.""

Reporters from Axios confirmed that Dunn's message meant he was considering a run for the seat.

Dunn wrote an editorial in Time magazine in which he noted the America we live in is ""the one we built by voting, by protesting, by agitating, by demanding, by being arrested, by getting into “some good trouble, necessary trouble.”

How does the news that Officer Dunn might run for Congress make you feel?"

I will be voting NO on all funding packages for the Ukraine war (as I have from the beginning) and now the Israel war.

We have had over 10 MILLION people illegally cross our border since Biden took office and we are over $33 TRILLION dollars in debt with many major problems afflicting Americans.

The United States government needs to focus on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars on our own country and needs to serve the American people NOT the rest of the world.

I voted YES on both resolutions condemning the attack on Ukraine and the attack on Israel however I will continue to vote NO on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars to fund wars defending foreign country’s borders while our own border is overrun and our own national security is at risk.

Also Ukraine and Israel are very different.

Ukraine is completely propped up by the US and continues to beg for more US tax dollars while Washington fights it’s proxy war with Russia and Israel is a strong thriving independent nation that prides itself on defending their own people. 

Also, there is $3.8 billion dollars readily available to Israel in the Defense approps bill and the State and Foreign Ops bill, but Schumer and the Senate have not lifted a finger to pass those bills and Biden has not signed them into law.

Our Republican House majority and new Speaker Johnson should refuse any more funding bills until the Senate does it’s job and our border is secure.

We’ve done our job in the House and we must keep passing our remaining Approps bills.

The Democrat controlled Senate has passed ZERO percent of the budget, while the House has passed over 70% of the budget.

Whether or not you think Tucker asked Andrew Tate the right questions, Tucker’s interest in the subject matter of corrupt governments colluding to take down individuals has remained consistent throughout his career. 

In essence, it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is possible to think that pornography in all its forms is wrong and not a marker of conservatism, while also believing that a person who ran a web cam business should not be targeted by governments."

"INCREDIBLE HERO WITHOUT A GUN: Much is made about a hypothetical ""good guy with a gun"" who never seems to show up, but a good guy with NO gun put himself between a mass shooter and as many as eight children to save the day.

Thomas Giberti wasn't expected at Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley in Maine, but his presence proved crucial when Robert Card, the murderous gunman of the Lewiston Maine mass shooting, entered and unleashed a barrage of bullets. 

Despite being off-duty, Giberti displayed incredible heroism, guiding as many as eight terrified children to safety while enduring multiple gunshot wounds to his legs.

Currently recovering in a central Maine hospital, Giberti's remarkable actions have earned him widespread acclaim from the global bowling community, as well as the people of Maine, his family, and friends. 

Samantha Juray, co-owner of the bowling alley and an eyewitness to Maine's largest modern mass shooting, witnessed Giberti's selfless bravery in the midst of the chaos.

Juray recounted how Giberti, initially working in the machines area, courageously placed himself in harm's way to rescue the young bowlers gathered for youth practice that night. 

She estimated that Giberti saved the lives of at least eight, possibly even a dozen, youth bowlers ranging from 5 to 18 years old.

Dan Delcourt, who has known Giberti for two decades as a fellow bowler and neighbor, was also present during the horrifying incident. Amid the confusion and loud bangs, Delcourt and his bowling league teammates rushed toward the fire exit. 

Although Delcourt didn't witness Giberti's specific actions in the chaos, he affirmed Giberti's reputation for prioritizing the safety of children.

""He’s always one to think of the kids first,"" Delcourt emphasized. ""He’s the best guy you can think of."" 

Thomas Giberti's heroism has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the community, demonstrating exceptional courage in the face of danger."

RESULT: 
General Motors reaches a deal with United Auto Workers, days after both Ford and Stellantis agreed to 25% wage increases, reinstated cost-of-living adjustments to protect workers from rising prices, and other significantly enhanced benefits.

"Harry loved his teddy’s so at the beginning of February 2022 I purchased this huge teddy for him from Costco. He didn’t really know what to do with it when I brought it home so it stayed mostly in tact. He then passed on August 22nd last year from cancer. The grief from losing him was excruciating. I thought I would not get another dog but the stars aligned and Ben came into my life in December 2022 just before Christmas. Whilst he was settling into his new home he took it upon himself to go and sleep on Harry’s teddy I had kept. I managed to capture the image all those months ago of Ben sleeping on the teddy. He has never slept on it since but I treasure this image so much. Ben has filled my heart again after the loss of Harry. What I have learnt from this experience is when losing a dog there is always place for another even if you don’t feel like it in the raw moment of grief. It honestly helped me cope with the loss of Harry. I will always miss him and by no means has he been replaced. He was a unique dog with his quirky personality (he suckled on his teddy’s before falling asleep). Love my two beagle boys. Once a beagle parent always a beagle parent. 🐶 🐾🦴🤍"

Let’s take a look:

piped.video/Yn8mt5wtQD8"
"Precisely this. 

It seems the police are not interested in the missing toddler portion of her story, nor do they deem it necessary to warn the public about a potential kidnapper on the loose… 

Or they simply know that those portions of #CarleeRussell’s story are untrue."
"Also worth noting that Carlee was treated and released from the hospital in less than 24 hours which allows us to gather that she was not found in a dire physical state— thankfully."
"The Hoover police have now confirmed that only #Carlee phoned in a report of having seen a toddler wearing a diaper walking down that busy interstate. 
That is indeed curious. 
Carlee’s boyfriend has posted an update on Facebook that she was kidnapped, but is now home safe—however the police have not confirmed the kidnapping detail in their update, nor did they deem it necessary to issue a warning for the public at large to remain vigilant. 
Worth noting this police statement also does not ask the public for help locating the alleged toddler— which in my view is the most critical element of this case. 
 
#CarleeRussell"
"Absolute mob scene for @VivekGRamaswamy at his Turning Point after party"
"My number one question regarding #CarleeRussell is whether any other driver on that busy interstate reported seeing a toddler walking along side of it?

Most important part of this story is whether there is an at-risk toddler. This is why her story must be further prodded."
"In the (albeit grainy) footage that has since emerged of Carlee stopping on the highway, there is no toddler seen. 

So yes, people have questions. 

A missing toddler is a serious enough allegation to maintain public interest until further details unfold. 

#CarleeRussell"
"Everyone is happy that #CarleeRussell was found alive. 
That said, it is reasonable that we have further questions since there was an alleged toddler wandering alone on the highway, which Carlee reported as a part of this story. 
Don’t gaslight people for having questions."

"I have a logical question for trump supporters:

1. If you accept trump's argument that anything and everything a President does while in office is above prosecution because he has some kind of ""presidential immunity""

2. AND you also embrace the irrational belief that President Biden is some kind of criminal mastermind who has no problem breaking the law

Theoretically, he could then probably do the EXACT same thing that trump is being prosecuted for (the fake electors scheme) to ensure that he stays in office, and avoid prosecution for it, since you believe Presidents are above prosecution.

So my question is, does that work for you?
Biden does a fake electors scheme, stays in office, and NO jail for him.

REMINDER: If President Biden goes to prison for it, trump goes first.

Let us know. We'll wait."
"🚨🚨BREAKING: She tried to avoid it, but Ivanka Trump now has to appear in court as a witness against her father in the $250 million financial fraud trial being conducted in New York City.

The eldest daughter of disgraced former president Trump has been compelled to appear in person as a witness, although Judge Engoron has granted her some time to file an appeal.

Judge Engoron emphasized his preference for in-person testimony, stating, “I want to see her in person. That is how we prefer testimony.”

Ivanka's legal team has expressed strong objections to this decision, deeming it ""a bridge too far."" State attorney Kevin Wallace, however, defended the subpoenas by pointing out that Ivanka Trump was a former Trump Organization executive who had significant dealings with lenders for Trump’s Washington D.C. Old Post Office hotel. 

Wallace added that Ivanka Trump still maintains property ownership and business operations in New York.

Judge Engoron justified his ruling by highlighting Ivanka Trump's continued property ownership and business activities in New York, despite her official residency in Florida. 

How does the news that she'll have to testify against her father make you feel?"

"Working service jobs can suck but there is something so creative and wonderful about a place to test out passive aggressive phrases. My current fave is “have the kind of day you deserve!”"
"I think, for things like this, above being funny is the ability to play along. To be silly and engage with others"
"I hope I go my whole life being an easy laugh. I hope I never get numb to that stuff."
"When a restaurant only serves their own, home made ketchup. That is such intense hubris. To think you could improve on an already perfect form. And now we all suffer because of it."

"I hope they give Riley a DSMP phase"
".@SpeakerMcCarthy is showing tremendous leadership by backing @Jim_Jordan for Speaker.

McCarthy could easily refuse to help Jim or work against him. But he just gave a nominating speech for him on the house floor.

I hope that the Jordan holdouts decide to follow McCarthy’s lead and do the right thing.

Republican voters across the country are asking for Speaker Jim Jordan."
"If McCarthy can get over what happened and support Jim Jordan for speaker why can’t the 22 holdouts?! Thank you @SpeakerMcCarthy for doing the right thing."

"Trump 2024"
"3 main takeaways from whatever that was:

- It’s shocking that Biden is still alive. He is deteriorating at an unbelievably rapid rate and the fact that Newsom is traveling to Israel right now gives me the growing impression that Biden won’t be the dems’ guy next year. 

- Another $100B in foreign aid - of your money. Biden is sacrificing our economy; your savings, your retirement, your future, for other countries’ borders while our own border is an unmitigated disaster. 

- Way too many people have their heads in the sand. We’re 340 million passengers on a ship of fools and when our nation’s men are more interested in the baseball game than they are in the fact that our ruling elites are walking us into WWIII while draining our economy in front of our eyes, we deserve everything that’s coming."
"Glad to see that @Jim_Jordan is going to stay and fight! MAGA!"
"The people across #NY21 and America can rest assured that I strongly oppose any attempt to create a Democrat backed coalition government.

I will vote to support Jim Jordan for Speaker on the House Floor. 

We must work to unify Republicans as the last line of defense to save America."
"Bring back Trump!"
"Thank you @Jim_Banks! A Speaker McHenry would be a gift to the Democrats. Republicans must oppose!"
"Call your members and encourage them to oppose the McHenry resolution: 202-225-3121"
"I obviously support @Jim_Jordan for speaker, but sadly a handful of people are preventing this from happening.

If Jordan doesn’t want to keep fighting for this right now, I understand. But he should give up being Speaker Designee so Republicans can get behind someone who is willing to fight.

A lot of damage can be done from now until January. A Speaker McHenry would be disastrous and would be a total FU to Republican voters."
"McCarthy needed 15 rounds to become Speaker, so why is Jim Jordan throwing in the towel after only 2?!

I think he’d make a great Speaker, but if he’s unwilling to continue fighting, then he needs to withdraw himself as Speaker designee and let someone else step in

No McHenry!!"
".@ByronDonalds for speaker"
"We need to stay here and elect a speaker. A temp speaker is not the solution."
"Trump 2024 🚀"
"I’m disgusted by the personal and vile attacks on @stclairashley coming from team desantis.

Ashley is a good person. Team DeSantis has NO CLASS!"
"I’m writing a censure resolution for Rashida Tlaib. 

After what she did today, I expect even Democrats will join in.

She is an Israel hating America hating woman who does not represent anything America stands for."
"I knew that Rob wore high heeled boots. His team got in my face at cpac and said that they aren’t “high heels” they’re “Cuban boots!” But now we have definitive proof that Rob is wearing hidden heels.

@NikkiHaley and @VivekGRamaswamy should demand that Rob wears normal shoes at the debate."

Will leave you sedated, hung over

But left curve-peanut M&M’s& other horrificly sugared candies somehow energize u if ur fit

Wake up shredded after eating king size"
"The seed oil stuff is incredibly overplayed, obviously, at this point. But I will concede that the one place it’s no joke is subway. With their sauces you can literally feel the seed oils leeching in & corroding your mitochondria. Pretty wild trip crazier than most hard drugs"
"Really is appalling how ppl try to replicate others’ success but only go 3-4x a week

Reality is success is extremely meticulous & trite.  The most boring tedious shit is what gets you everything you want

You do it for the sake of success & no other reason"
"Showing up is 95% of winning

Of course I’m a talented lifter.  Trained every single day for 10+ years no matter how bad my circumstances.  Showed up with the flu, a cold, even if I was broke, hungry.  Kept going one day at a time

When ur looking at urself from the birds eye ur always fucked up

Focus needs to shift to everything else from 3rd point of view like a hunter.  But never the self"

Golden opposed a ban on assault weapons, admitted he was wrong, and now asks his constituents for forgiveness and urges Congress to ban them.

We need more of THIS."
"When Republicans say ""now is not the time to talk about guns,"" reporters should immediately follow up with ""OK, when is the time?""

And keep asking."
"Every Western nation was citizens with mental health problems, but the United States is the only one with almost-daily mass shootings. And with 400 million guns in America, Republicans think the answer is more guns.

If Republicans had any sense, they'd #BanAssaultWeaponsNow."
"Rep Golden: “I’ve opposed efforts to ban weapons of war like the assault rifle used to carry out this crime. The time has come for me to take responsibility for this failure, which is why I now call on Congress to ban assault rifles.” #BanAssaultWeaponsNow"
"FRIENDS: The risk of a person in the U.S. dying in a mass shooting was 70% lower during the period of the assault weapons ban.

Please and thank you! 🙏💪"
"As our nation reels from the horrific mass shooting in Lewiston, ME, we must be resolute to prevent gun violence.

"Good lord, Jemele argued that we (black people) ""fought diligently for Asian American rights."" This is the kind of detached-from-reality logic that earned her promotions at the Detroit Free Press, Orlando Sentinel and ESPN. Or was it Affirmative Action? There is far more proof (and burial plots) of white evangelicals fighting for black American rights than black Americans fighting for the rights of Asians. She's just dumb and dishonest. She's exhibit A in why the elimination of Affirmative Action is necessary. Credentialing idiots is not a good idea."
"I was hoping to hit a million followers by July 4th so I can rule the country from the shadows but it looks like I will miss the target by a few days."
"How are there still black and white Americans that do not realize how openly racist and hostile this society has become toward white people. Can you imagine ANY journalist publishing an article with the title “mediocre blacks can rest easier”? 

Appallingly racist. @thenation"
"And the audacity given the fact that her children are literally benefiting from legacy admissions at Harvard. 

It really is clown world sometimes."
"The university system is the most elaborate and expensive scam of all time. Most people come out of it dumber and less qualified than they were going in. It does not teach any useful skills. You do not need it to succeed in life. It bankrupts millions of young Americans and gives them nothing in return. Maybe we should focus on that problem instead of “loan forgiveness”"
"I don’t know about you but I’m starting to think that liberals showing up outside of the Supreme Court Justices’ homes and threatening to kill them over Roe v. Wade, did not age well."
"If white people would like to have a greater presence in the NBA, then they are going to have to work at their jump shots. 

If black people would like to have a greater presence at Harvard, then we are going to have to work at our academics. 

This is not hard."
"I am not bothered by the fact that black Americans dominate Asian and white Americans in basketball and football. 

We are simply better at those sports and the best players who train the hardest and therefore score the most points should play. 

This isn’t complicated."
"Imagine if the NBA declined Lebron James because there were “too many black people in the NBA” and they wanted racial diversity—so they instead allowed Ed Sheeran onto the Lakers in his place. 

That is exactly what Asian-Americans have been enduring for decades at Harvard."
"I just can’t get over how implausibly stupid this is. 
Everyone’s debating affirmative action and @AOC is over here like: 

K BUT WHY DIDN’T THEY JUST DECIDE ON A CASE THAT WAS NEVER BROUGHT BEFORE THEM?!

How is she just allowed to be this unabashedly thick in public life?"
"She quite literally has no idea what the function of the Supreme Court is or what the case was before them. 

There is no bottom to her stupidity."
"How devastating for Michelle Obama to learn that whether someone is black or white or Hispanic, or Asian—they will all be treated the same in the college admissions process. 

What will black America do without racist, preferential treatment?"
"Exactly this. 
Transgenderism is, among other things, an utterly fictitious “civil rights” movement, comprised mostly of a bunch of mentally deranged gay men that are looking for permission to live out their sexual fetishes publicly."
"Case in point: here is Dylan “I’m scared to leave my house” Mulvaney pictured last week, wearing an 800$ bra with Olivia Wilde. 

The whole lot of you need to just stfu with your fake victim act."
"No one threatened to kill Dylan Mulvaney. We threatened to (and made good on) no longer drinking Bud Light.
I’m so sick of the “trans community” pretending they are black people surviving the klan in the 1920’s—while their shake their fake implants on the White House lawn."

"What a great day for Asian Americans who have endured flagrant educational discrimination because…they do everything right. 

So glad that you will finally get into the schools that you deserve to get into based on the hard work you put in. 

#AffirmativeAction is over."
"It even harms the black people it purports to help who are relegated to academic probation for having been artificially mismatched into schools, whereas they might succeed were they placed into other schools based upon their intellectual merit."
"An unfortunate but true conclusion I’ve reached is that voters don’t have a worldview, they have a Guy. There’s how they understand the world. Their Man is good. Other Man Bad. It’s why so many “influencers” degrade themselves by pandering and lying. Some don’t want to do this!"
"Easily the most interesting candidates in the field."
"Sorry to the say it but the Desantis campaign was dead on arrival and it’s time to admit it. 

Tons of mistakes. 

Needed to be more upfront about his intention to run. Doesn’t come across as honest and he’s boring. (You can say it shouldn’t matter but it does). 

He also needed someone more like Kayleigh McEnany rather than petty Christina Pushaw running comms. 

The influencers that are still cheerleading for him are those that recently moved to his state and want to reap the benefits for standing firm beside him through his inevitable loss. 

I’m not knocking the influencer-hustle, just calling it as I see it. They know he can’t win either."
"I sleep well knowing that people are mad at me for calling out Trump when he baselessly attacks someone like Kayleigh. 
Mad at me for agreeing with RFK. Jr on vaccines. 
Mad at me for stating the obvious that Desantis won’t win but IS a good Governor. 

It’s good to be free."
"I’d still support him as Governor.

What’s become clear to me is he resents not just Trump— but more problematically, his supporters. I think he’s honestly disgusted by Trump supporters. 

He and his team are grossed out by small town-people. That’s the vibe I catch."
"Also their weird takeover of their community notes gives people a “fact-checker” vibe. Sometimes the notes they add don’t actually debunk anything. Getting very Snopes-like. 

(@ChristinaPushaw please don’t community note my opinion!)"
"It’s important to note that the SCOTUS decision is very narrow

Only 9 states ban affirmative action. If you’re a state legislator, you should be putting forward a bill to ban it in your state."
"dailymail.co.uk/news/article…"
"Wow!! Affirmative action, something I have spoken out against for the last 7 years, has FINALLY been struck down in a historic Supreme Court ruling. 

This is a MAJOR WIN in the strive for racial equality, removing the bigotry of low expectations against black students, while permitting Asian and white Americans an EQUAL chance to be rewarded for their hard work. RACE should never be a factor in deciding whether or not you are qualified for anything. 

It’s a shame it took this long, but finally— justice wins!

"This chart kills me. Only 601 cases of tetanus before the vaccines in the U.S Now every parent thinks their child is going to die from stepping on a rusty nail. Where did they get that idea? From Big Pharma ads. 
Today 1 in 36 kids has autism. This insanity needs to stop."
"Virtually no one was dying of Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Chickenpox, Tetanus in the United States. It’s insane that parents don’t know this and genuinely fear these diseases so much that they put their children at risk for cancer, seizures, lifelong mental impairment, autoimmune disorders and sudden death."
"Speak to kids today and they are terrified of chicken pox because Big Pharma has lied about it. 
Parents will risk giving their children lifelong autoimmune disorders, cancer, sudden infant death, etc bc Big Pharma has made them arbitrarily fearful of getting sick for a few days."

"‼️It’s true, my YouTube account has been suspended and here is what I have to say:

We don’t know exactly what or who is the driving force behind globally-sanctioned lies, but what we do know is that over the past five years, the prevailing lies of the day have shifted dramatically. 
It was Black Lives Matter in 2020 when corporations, governments, and Hollywood were in lockstep flying black-fist flags and encouraging people to donate their money as a penance, for the sin of being born white. 
Then the lie switched rather dramatically to COVID. People were encouraged to mask-up, avoid their family members, roll up their sleeves and submit to a “safe and effective vaccine” via a globally-sponsored lie that it would protect them from getting a virus. 
Of course, both of these tremendous lies fell a part with time. The corporation of Black Lives Matter was revealed to be fraudulent— siphoning money away from well-meaning citizens in order to enrich—not black Americans of course—but various transgendered causes as well as the BLM founder’s close circle of family and friends. 
Today, the new and perhaps most insidious globally agreed upon lie is that individuals can choose or magically switch their genders. Why is this lie the most insidious? Other than its frightful illumination of western idiocy, it’s the most insidious because it targets children, specifically. 

If it needs reminding, there exists no world and certainly no cultural moment in which I become a buck that can be broken. 

Just as with the previous globally-sanctioned lies, I will in no way submit to it. Like in the previous globally-perpetuated circumstances, me and those who stand against it will be maimed and caricatured in the media. And then just like in those previous circumstances, the few of us with the courage to stand against the tides of pop-fiction will be vindicated. 

Because in the end, truth wins. 

Until then."

"❗️Important @officialpsq Update:

Our operations are going even better than anticipated and I’m excited to highlight the growth we’ve experienced, the strength of our balance sheet, and the continued commitment to our goals from management and our insiders, none of whom have sold even a single share of our stock.

- Our preliminary third quarter revenue grew approximately 300% from Q2 2023, to an estimated $2.2 million, which represents 1,600% year-over-year growth.

- Growth was led by @everylife, our direct-to-consumer pro-life baby care brand, which has, in less than 3 months of operations, achieved over $3.5 million of annualized subscription revenue.

- Our eCommerce shopping experience will roll out on November 1st, in time for the holiday shopping season, and we anticipate over 400,000 products ready for purchase in app.

- Our next wholly-owned subsidiary after EveryLife, PSQLink, which offers a business management tool, will launch this month.

These results speak not just to our rapid early adoption, but to our conviction that patriotic consumers and businesses alike seek a values-aligned commerce ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with over $25M of cash on our balance sheet and we intend to achieve our first profitable quarter in 2024. 

We’re building this business for the long-term, changing the country through the power of the marketplace, and we’re just getting started 🇺🇸

"""In 2018, President Trump exited Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions on their oil. However, Biden employed lax enforcement of those sanctions as Tehran worked with and sold their oil with the help of China and Venezuela. Biden’s move is so lucrative to Iran that their oil exports reached record levels in 2022. All of this done under the foolish guise that Iran would be more open to negotiate a nuclear deal. Biden is so desperate to repeat Obama’s failures that he allowed Iran to make untold billions from oil.”
